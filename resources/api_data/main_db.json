Poland has a bicameral Parliament composed of a 100-seat Senate and a 460-seat Sejm. Senators are directly elected by plurality vote in single-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Members of the Sejm are directly elected by party-list proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties must earn at least 5% of the national vote to gain a seat in the Sejm, and coalitions must earn 8% of the vote with minority parties excepted from this standard.  Poland has two high courts: the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is composed of 121 judges separated into thematic chambers. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the National Judicial Council and confirmed by the President, and they may serve until age 65. The Constitutional Tribunal is composed of 15 judges appointed by the Sejm to serve a 9-year term.",

Executive power is nominally exercised by the government, at its top sits a ceremonial prime minister, appointed directly by the President.  Legislative power is de jure vested in the bicameral parliament, the National Assembly. The 110 members of the lower House of Representatives are directly elected for five-year terms under a majoritarian system in single-member constituencies. The Council of the Republic is the upper chamber of territorial representation, its members elected at meetings of the local councils of deputies and the City of Minsk, plus eight members appointed by the President of the Republic.  The Constitutional Court is the highest court in Belarus which deals with matters involving the Constitution and legality of certain laws passed by the government. The Supreme Court is the highest court of general jurisdiction that deals with matters of civil and criminal law.",

Changes brought about by the 2001 constitution granted the three main islands partial autonomy, and each elects its own governor and legislative assembly. The government of each island is free to administer its own affairs so long as its actions do not infringe upon the rights of the other islands or otherwise threaten the state of the federal union.",

      "details": "The new constitution submitted to referendum largely reproduces the text of the 1996 Constitution. Unlike the 2018 Constitution, the latter benefits from a better image, being the fruit of numerous consultations that led to a consensus during the Sovereign National Conference organised in 1993.  The text of this new fundamental law - the eleventh since the country's independence in 1960 - marks a return to a semi-presidential system, replacing the presidential system of 2018 by confirming the restoration of the post of Prime Minister as head of government accountable to the National Assembly, distinct from the role of Head of State of the President of the Republic. The President's term of office will be reduced from six to five years, always renewable once consecutively. The minimum age for presidential candidates is lowered from 40 to 35. The draft constitution also ratifies the existence of the Senate, which was theoretically created by the 2018 constitution but has never yet been set up, as well as the division of the country into 23 regions, or provinces.  The text is also notable for its objective of restoring a number of rights, concepts and democratic institutions that had been removed from the 1996 text by a succession of constitutional revisions under the presidency of Idriss Déby. Independence of the judiciary has been consolidated by assigning the chairmanship of the High Council of the Judiciary not to the President of the Republic but to the President of the Supreme Court, who was previously second vice-president. The High Court of Justice, placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2018, has also regained its independence as an institution, and the sole power to try for high treason the President of the Republic, those of other institutions, as well as members of the government and their possible accomplices.The same applies to the Constitutional Council, which regains its independence from the Supreme Court and exercises sole control over the constitutionality of laws, organic laws, decrees and international treaties.Its review is carried out automatically before they are promulgated, but also a posteriori on the basis of a dispute referred to the Council by an ordinary court.The Council also judges electoral disputes and administers the oath of office to the newly elected President of the Republic.  In terms of military justice, a Court of Appeal was created, in addition to the military courts and the Supreme Court.",

For these elections, polling stations are opened outside the diplomatic and consular representations of the Republic of Bulgaria in countries that are not members of the European Union.  The places and countries where polling stations are opened and voting can be done outside the country are announced on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after their final determination by the Central Election Commission - by May 18, 2024. Voters wishing to cast their votes outside of Bulgaria may pre-register for their preferred polling location via a form on the CEC website or vote at any polling station abroad without prior registration upon showing their Bulgarian ID documents and declaring that they have not voted and will not vote elsewhere.",

        "instructions": "Voters vote in person at their designated polling station. However, polling commission members and security officers are allowed to vote at the polling station of their duty; students are entitled to vote in the  municipality where they study; and persons with disabilitiles may vote in any suitable polling station of their choice without submitting a prior request. Up until 14 days before election day, candidates, higher level election officials, and accredited observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency. Up until 14 days before election day, any voter can request inclusion in the voter lists at the place of their current (temporary) registered residence. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. In polling stations with at least 300 registered voters, the voters have the option to use either paper ballot voting or direct recording electronic voting machines.  If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting screen and in private marks the square of the candidate list of his/her choice and if so wishes, also marks the circle of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, leaves the screen and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list and if he/she chooses, also for a candidate on the list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and the voted ballot is printed and the voter proceeds to cast the printed ballot in the same way as the paper ballots are cast. The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.",

Bulgaria has a unicameral National Assembly (Народно събрание / Narodno Sabranie) with 240 seats. Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

However, polling commission members and security officers are allowed to vote at the polling station of their duty; students are entitled to vote in the  municipality where they study; and persons with disabilitiles may vote in any suitable polling station of their choice without submitting a prior request. Up until 14 days before election day, candidates, higher level election officials, and accredited observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency. Up until 14 days before election day, any voter can request inclusion in the voter lists at the place of their current (temporary) registered residence. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. In polling stations with at least 300 registered voters, the voters have the option to use either paper ballot voting or direct recording electronic voting machines.  If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting screen and in private marks the square of the candidate list of his/her choice and if so wishes, also marks the circle of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, leaves the screen and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list and if he/she chooses, also for a candidate on the list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and the voted ballot is printed and the voter proceeds to cast the printed ballot in the same way as the paper ballots are cast. The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.",

Bulgaria has a unicameral National Assembly (Народно събрание / Narodno Sabranie) with 240 seats. Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

After the voter marks the ballot, he/she returns it to the chairperson who puts it in the ballot box. The polling clerk then enters a mark in the voter list in front of the name of the voter who cast his/her ballot to indicate the voter has voted.  A voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can state his/her choice orally so that only the members of the polling committee can hear it (or just the chairperson) and the chairperson marks the voter's choice on the ballot paper and puts it in the ballot box.",

The Crown Prince is also designated as the Heir Apparent and the National Assembly must swear fealty to the Crown Prince.   Kuwait has a unicameral National Assembly (Majlis al-Umma), which has 50 members and 15 ex-officio seats reserved for cabinet ministers. Per the Constitution, there may be more ministers (and thus ex-officio members) so long as the number of ministers does not exceed one-third of the total assembly.   The highest courts in Kuwait are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. All judges are appointed by the Amir on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council. ",

The real executive power rests with the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the majority party or coalition in the National Assembly. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet, which he or she leads, are responsible for the day-to-day administration of government and the implementation of legislation. The Legislature is unicameral, consisting of the National Assembly with 70 members, 62 of whom are elected from 21 constituencies. The remaining eight are appointed from among the best losing candidates to ensure representation of ethnic minorities, a process known as the \"Best Loser System.\" The judicial system is headed by the Supreme Court, which has unlimited jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters and also acts as an appellate court from decisions of lower courts and tribunals.",

The presiding officer or a polling officer must ascertain by examining and by asking relevant questions relating to the particulars appearing on the voter registration card that the voter is the person whose name, photograph and other particulars appears on the voter registration card; and the voter registration card is a voter registration card officially issued according to the Electoral Act. The presiding officer must also ascertain that the voter has not already voted in the election concerned.\n \n3. The presiding officer or a polling officer must require the voter, and the voter when so required, is obliged to cause his or her fingers to be examined by the presiding officer or the polling officer.\n \n4. If upon an examination referred to in the last Section no finger or fingers of the voter display the identification mark so approved and determined as contemplated in subsections (12) and (13) of the Electoral Act, the voter is presumed not to have already voted in the election concerned. On the other hand, if upon an examination referred to in the last Section, a finger or fingers of the voter display the identification mark, the presiding officer must give to every election agent who is present an opportunity to observe the identification mark; and may not permit the voter to vote. If any person has been prohibited from voting, the presiding officer must endorse the relevant voters’ register to the effect that the person was so prohibited.\n \n5. After verifying its identification status, the presiding officer or polling officer must return the voter registration card to the voter concerned. Afterward, the voter must in the presence and in accordance with the instructions of the presiding officer or a polling officer place the identification mark on the finger or fingers of his or her left hand or of his or her right hand, as may be determine, by the Chief Electoral Officer for the purposes of the election concerned; or cause it to be placed thereon by the presiding officer or the polling officer.\n \n6. If a voter refuses that the prescribed identification mark be applied to his or her finger or fingers, the voter may not be issued with a ballot paper, the voter is not permitted to vote, either by way of a ballot paper or by way of a voting machine. The presiding officer or polling officer must record in the Occurrence Book at the polling station the fact that the voter refuses that the prescribed identification mark be applied to his or her finger, request the police officer in charge of the polling station or any other police officer on duty at the polling station to remove the voter concerned from the polling station.\n \n7. If the voter complied with the provisions concerning identification, the presiding officer or polling officer must in the case of voting by way of a ballot paper, enter the voter registration number of the voter in the ballot paper book on the counterfoil of a ballot paper which bears on the back thereof the official mark, and detach the ballot paper from its counterfoil and deliver it to the voter; or in the case of voting by way of a voting machine, enter the voter registration number of the voter in a voting machine book, as determined by the Commission.\n8. Upon receiving the ballot paper, or if the voter is voting by way of a voting machine, the voter must enter a polling booth provided at the polling station, and secretly record in the case of voting by way of a ballot paper, his or her vote on the ballot paper by marking in the case of an election on party lists, the ballot paper with a mark in or next to the space opposite the name of the political party or organisation for which he or she desires to vote; or in the case of an election otherwise than on party lists, the ballot paper with a mark in or next to the space opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote. In the case of voting by way of a voting machine, his or her vote on the voting machine by selecting in the case of an election on party lists, in or next to the space opposite the name of the political party or organisation for which he or she desires to vote; or in the case of an election otherwise than on party lists, in or next to the space opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote.\n \n9. While still in the polling booth, fold the ballot paper in a way that the official mark is visible; and the names of the political parties or candidates and the mark signifying his or her vote are not visible, leave the polling booth and display the ballot paper to the presiding officer or polling officer in a way that the official mark can be seen; and in the presence of the presiding officer or polling officer, drop, the ballot paper in the ballot box for ordinary ballot papers.",

A voter may only vote in an election if the voter produces his or her voter registration card for the election concerned to the presiding officer or a polling officer.\n \n2. The presiding officer or a polling officer must ascertain by examining and by asking relevant questions relating to the particulars appearing on the voter registration card that the voter is the person whose name, photograph and other particulars appears on the voter registration card; and the voter registration card is a voter registration card officially issued according to the Electoral Act. The presiding officer must also ascertain that the voter has not already voted in the election concerned.\n \n3. The presiding officer or a polling officer must require the voter, and the voter when so required, is obliged to cause his or her fingers to be examined by the presiding officer or the polling officer.\n \n4. If upon an examination referred to in the last Section no finger or fingers of the voter display the identification mark so approved and determined as contemplated in subsections (12) and (13) of the Electoral Act, the voter is presumed not to have already voted in the election concerned. On the other hand, if upon an examination referred to in the last Section, a finger or fingers of the voter display the identification mark, the presiding officer must give to every election agent who is present an opportunity to observe the identification mark; and may not permit the voter to vote. If any person has been prohibited from voting, the presiding officer must endorse the relevant voters’ register to the effect that the person was so prohibited.\n \n5. After verifying its identification status, the presiding officer or polling officer must return the voter registration card to the voter concerned. Afterward, the voter must in the presence and in accordance with the instructions of the presiding officer or a polling officer place the identification mark on the finger or fingers of his or her left hand or of his or her right hand, as may be determine, by the Chief Electoral Officer for the purposes of the election concerned; or cause it to be placed thereon by the presiding officer or the polling officer.\n \n6. If a voter refuses that the prescribed identification mark be applied to his or her finger or fingers, the voter may not be issued with a ballot paper, the voter is not permitted to vote, either by way of a ballot paper or by way of a voting machine. The presiding officer or polling officer must record in the Occurrence Book at the polling station the fact that the voter refuses that the prescribed identification mark be applied to his or her finger, request the police officer in charge of the polling station or any other police officer on duty at the polling station to remove the voter concerned from the polling station.\n \n7. If the voter complied with the provisions concerning identification, the presiding officer or polling officer must in the case of voting by way of a ballot paper, enter the voter registration number of the voter in the ballot paper book on the counterfoil of a ballot paper which bears on the back thereof the official mark, and detach the ballot paper from its counterfoil and deliver it to the voter; or in the case of voting by way of a voting machine, enter the voter registration number of the voter in a voting machine book, as determined by the Commission.\n \n8. Upon receiving the ballot paper, or if the voter is voting by way of a voting machine, the voter must enter a polling booth provided at the polling station, and secretly record in the case of voting by way of a ballot paper, his or her vote on the ballot paper by marking in the case of an election on party lists, the ballot paper with a mark in or next to the space opposite the name of the political party or organisation for which he or she desires to vote; or in the case of an election otherwise than on party lists, the ballot paper with a mark in or next to the space opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote. In the case of voting by way of a voting machine, his or her vote on the voting machine by selecting in the case of an election on party lists, in or next to the space opposite the name of the political party or organisation for which he or she desires to vote; or in the case of an election otherwise than on party lists, in or next to the space opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote.\n \n9. While still in the polling booth, fold the ballot paper in a way that the official mark is visible; and the names of the political parties or candidates and the mark signifying his or her vote are not visible, leave the polling booth and display the ballot paper to the presiding officer or polling officer in a way that the official mark can be seen; and in the presence of the presiding officer or polling officer, drop, the ballot paper in the ballot box for ordinary ballot papers.",

      "details": "The new constitution submitted to referendum largely reproduces the text of the 1996 Constitution. Unlike the 2018 Constitution, the latter benefits from a better image, being the fruit of numerous consultations that led to a consensus during the Sovereign National Conference organised in 1993.  The text of this new fundamental law - the eleventh since the country's independence in 1960 - marks a return to a semi-presidential system, replacing the presidential system of 2018 by confirming the restoration of the post of Prime Minister as head of government accountable to the National Assembly, distinct from the role of Head of State of the President of the Republic. The President's term of office will be reduced from six to five years, always renewable once consecutively. The minimum age for presidential candidates is lowered from 40 to 35. The draft constitution also ratifies the existence of the Senate, which was theoretically created by the 2018 constitution but has never yet been set up, as well as the division of the country into 23 regions, or provinces.  The text is also notable for its objective of restoring a number of rights, concepts and democratic institutions that had been removed from the 1996 text by a succession of constitutional revisions under the presidency of Idriss Déby. Independence of the judiciary has been consolidated by assigning the chairmanship of the High Council of the Judiciary not to the President of the Republic but to the President of the Supreme Court, who was previously second vice-president. The High Court of Justice, placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2018, has also regained its independence as an institution, and the sole power to try for high treason the President of the Republic, those of other institutions, as well as members of the government and their possible accomplices.The same applies to the Constitutional Council, which regains its independence from the Supreme Court and exercises sole control over the constitutionality of laws, organic laws, decrees and international treaties.Its review is carried out automatically before they are promulgated, but also a posteriori on the basis of a dispute referred to the Council by an ordinary court.The Council also judges electoral disputes and administers the oath of office to the newly elected President of the Republic.  In terms of military justice, a Court of Appeal was created, in addition to the military courts and the Supreme Court.",

      "details": "Jordan is a constitutional, hereditary monarchy with a parliamentary government. The king remains the country’s ultimate authority and wields power over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The king appoints the prime minister who then chooses a cabinet.  Both the prime minister and cabinet appointments must be approved by the parliament.  Jordan has a bicameral National Assembly (Majlis al-Ummah), with a Senate (Majlis al-Aʿyan) as its upper chamber, and a House of Representatives (Majlis al-Nuwwāb) as its lower chamber. Members of the Senate are appointed by the king for four-year terms, while members of the House of Representatives are elected every four years. A small number of seats in the House of Representatives are reserved for Christians and Circassians.  Judges are appointed and dismissed by royal decree following a decision made by the Justices Council. There are three categories of courts. The regular courts, including those of magistrates, courts of first instance, and courts of appeals and cassation in Amman, hear appeals passed on from lower courts. The constitution also provides for a Special Council, which interprets the laws and determines their constitutionality. There are also religious courts and special courts which deal with particular matters such as land, taxes, and customs.",

According to the United States Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, forty-five days before November general elections, each state will send voter abroad a blank ballot either electronically or via mail at the address you provided on the Federal Post Card Application (FVAP). Each voter must return the ballot complying with the deadlines set by each state.\n\nOverseas voters have a number of options for returning completed ballots:\n1. Local mail – If you have a reliable mail service to the United States, put your ballot in the mail with appropriate international postage.\n2. U.S. Embassy Diplomatic Pouch – The voter or another person can drop off your ballot request or completed ballot at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for return to the United States. It must be addressed to the local election officials and have sufficient U.S. postage, or be in a postage-paid envelope. A postage-paid envelope is available on the FVAP website. Contact the U.S. embassy voting assistance officer or visit the embassy’s website for specific instructions.\n3. Fax, Email, or Internet – Some states permit electronic transmission of completed ballots. Consult the Voting Assistance Guide for options in the voter's state.\n4. Express Courier Service – If time is short or local mail unreliable, the voter can use professional courier services such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS at the voters' own expense.\n\nIf the voter completed all required steps but have not received the ballot 30 days before an election, it must submit a completed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). The voter must contact the voting assistance officer at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for help, or visit the Foreign Voting Assistance Program website  to complete an FWAB using the online assistant. Write in the candidates of your choice, then print, sign, and send the FWAB to the local election officials. If the regular absentee ballot arrives after submitting a FWAB, it should still complete and return it. The voter's FWAB will be counted only if its regular ballot does not reach local election officials by the voter's state’s deadline.

All early mail ballots include a pre-paid Return Envelope, the voter must place the Security Envelope in the Return Envelope. The Return Envelope does not require any additional postage. Finally, the voter must seal the Return Envelope.\n\nIn Indiana, the voter will receive an absentee-by-mail ballot via the United States Postal Service.

If you do not possess a form of acceptable photo identification and you cannot reasonably obtain one, show a supporting form of identification to the election official and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. The election official will ask if you have moved and then ask you to sign the list of people who have voted in the precinct. Depending on the type of election – local, statewide, national, or combination – you will be handed: A paper ballot on which you will select your choices and which will be counted by hand; A paper ballot on which you will select your choices by darkening an oval, completing an arrow, or “marking” with the aid of a voting machine; or, a slip of paper with a numerical access code or, in some counties, a ballot activator card.

Local mail – If you have a reliable mail service to the United States, put your ballot in the mail with appropriate international postage.\n2.

Contact the U.S. embassy voting assistance officer or visit the embassy’s website for specific instructions.\n3. Fax, Email, or Internet – Some states permit electronic transmission of completed ballots. Consult the Voting Assistance Guide for options in the voter's state.\n4. Express Courier Service – If time is short or local mail unreliable, the voter can use professional courier services such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS at the voters' own expense.\n\nIf the voter completed all required steps but have not received the ballot 30 days before an election, it must submit a completed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). The voter must contact the voting assistance officer at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for help, or visit the Foreign Voting Assistance Program website  to complete an FWAB using the online assistant. Write in the candidates of your choice, then print, sign, and send the FWAB to the local election officials. If the regular absentee ballot arrives after submitting a FWAB, it should still complete and return it. The voter's FWAB will be counted only if its regular ballot does not reach local election officials by the voter's state’s deadline.

For example, in Texas, when voting early, when you arrive at the polling place, you will be asked to present one of the seven acceptable forms of photo identification, unless you are a voter with a permanent exemption on your voter registration certificate. If you do not possess a form of acceptable photo identification and you cannot reasonably obtain one, show a supporting form of identification to the election official and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. The election official will ask if you have moved and then ask you to sign the list of people who have voted in the precinct. Depending on the type of election – local, statewide, national, or combination – you will be handed: A paper ballot on which you will select your choices and which will be counted by hand; A paper ballot on which you will select your choices by darkening an oval, completing an arrow, or “marking” with the aid of a voting machine; or, a slip of paper with a numerical access code or, in some counties, a ballot activator card. In the next available voting booth, enter your code or card and let the on-screen instructions guide you through the process of electronic voting. In Georgia, when you arrive at your early voting location, you'll need to bring a valid photo ID such as a driver's license, passport, or voter identification card. The polls offer audio ballots for voters who are blind or have low vision, and booths for voters in wheelchairs. If you need help with your ballot, you can ask a family member or friend to come with you to the polls and fill the ballot in with your choices. If you can’t vote in person – either early or on Election Day – you also have the option to request an absentee ballot to vote by mail.            ",

They will confirm the voter's eligibility to vote and put its name on a list to receive absentee ballots for any elections held that calendar year, and they will send the voter a blank absentee ballot electronically or by mail. According to the United States Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, forty-five days before November general elections, each state will send voter abroad a blank ballot either electronically or via mail at the address you provided on the Federal Post Card Application (FVAP). Each voter must return the ballot complying with the deadlines set by each state.\n\nOverseas voters have a number of options for returning completed ballots:\n1. Local mail – If you have a reliable mail service to the United States, put your ballot in the mail with appropriate international postage.\n2. U.S. Embassy Diplomatic Pouch – The voter or another person can drop off your ballot request or completed ballot at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for return to the United States. It must be addressed to the local election officials and have sufficient U.S. postage, or be in a postage-paid envelope. A postage-paid envelope is available on the FVAP website. Contact the U.S. embassy voting assistance officer or visit the embassy’s website for specific instructions.\n3. Fax, Email, or Internet – Some states permit electronic transmission of completed ballots. Consult the Voting Assistance Guide for options in the voter's state.\n4. Express Courier Service – If time is short or local mail unreliable, the voter can use professional courier services such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS at the voters' own expense.\n\nIf the voter completed all required steps but have not received the ballot 30 days before an election, it must submit a completed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). The voter must contact the voting assistance officer at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for help, or visit the Foreign Voting Assistance Program website  to complete an FWAB using the online assistant. Write in the candidates of your choice, then print, sign, and send the FWAB to the local election officials. If the regular absentee ballot arrives after submitting a FWAB, it should still complete and return it. The voter's FWAB will be counted only if its regular ballot does not reach local election officials by the voter's state’s deadline. This will not invalidate the vote or result in casting two votes.",

The National Council of Provinces represents the provinces to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government. It does this mainly by participating in the national legislative process and by providing a national forum for public consideration of issues affecting the provinces. The National Assembly consists of no fewer than 350 and no more than 400 women and men elected through proportional representation. The National Council of Provinces is composed of a single delegation from each province consisting of ten delegates.\n\nThe President is the Head of State and the head of the national executive. The President is responsible for assenting to and signing bills, implementing together with other members of the Cabinet national legislation except where the Constitution or and Act of Parliament provides otherwise, and developing and implementing national policy. The President is elected by the National Assembly at its first sitting.\n\nThe judicial authority of the Republic is vested in the courts. The courts are independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law, which they must apply impartially. The courts are: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, the High Court of South Africa, the Magistrates´ Courts, and any other court established by an Act of Parliament. The President of the Republic, after consulting with the Judicial Service Commission and the leaders of the parties represented in the National Assembly, appoints the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice, and, after consulting the Judicial Service Commission, appoints the President and Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Appeal. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the President, as head of the national executive, after consulting the Chief Justice and the leaders of the parties represented in the National Assembly.

The president selects a prime minister, who serves as the head of government.\n\nLegislative power is exercised by a bicameral parliament, which consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Deputies serve five-year terms. About two-thirds are directly elected. The rest of the deputies are indirectly elected: two are elected by the National Youth Council; one is elected by the Federation of the Association of the Disabled; and the remaining seats are allocated to female representatives elected by local government bodies. Senators serve nonrenewable eight-year terms; under the 2015 amended Constitution, that will change to a five-year term, renewable once, beginning after 2019. Twelve are elected by local government bodies; two are elected from among lecturers and researchers of universities and institutions of higher education, one from public universities and one from private universities; eight are selected by the president; and four are selected by the Forum of Political Organizations (a regulatory body).",

In 2015 the Constitution was amended to allow the president at the time, Paul Kagame, to run for a third consecutive seven-year term in 2017 and, after that, for presidents to serve a five-year term renewable once. The president selects a prime minister, who serves as the head of government.\n\nLegislative power is exercised by a bicameral parliament, which consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Deputies serve five-year terms. About two-thirds are directly elected. The rest of the deputies are indirectly elected: two are elected by the National Youth Council; one is elected by the Federation of the Association of the Disabled; and the remaining seats are allocated to female representatives elected by local government bodies. Senators serve nonrenewable eight-year terms; under the 2015 amended Constitution, that will change to a five-year term, renewable once, beginning after 2019. Twelve are elected by local government bodies; two are elected from among lecturers and researchers of universities and institutions of higher education, one from public universities and one from private universities; eight are selected by the president; and four are selected by the Forum of Political Organizations (a regulatory body).",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

      "details": "The political, administrative and legal systems The Constitution Austria is a democratic republic. The territory of the Federal Republic consists of nine federal states or provinces (Bundesland, Land; plural: Bundesländer, Länder). Vienna is the federal capital and the seat of the supreme federal authorities. Since 1995, Austria is a member state of the European Union.   Elections All political institutions established by the Constitution derive their powers either directly or indirectly from elections by secret, personal and equal ballot.  Austrian citizens elect  the National Assembly (Nationalrat, the people’s chamber of Parliament) – every five years the Provincial Parliament (Landtag, Parliament of a Province) – every five or six years the Municipal Council (EU citizens resident in the municipality can also vote) – every five or six years the Austrian Members of the European Parliament (citizens of other EU countries with their main residence in Austria have the right to vote) the Federal President – every six years Other instruments of democracy are the referendum or plebiscite (Volksbefragung, Volksabstimmung, Volksbegehren).  All Austrians (and some citizens of other EU member states) who reach age 16 before the appointed date can vote.  The Parliament The Austrian Parliament consists of two chambers: the National Assembly (Nationalrat) and the Federal Council (Bundesrat).  The National Assembly is the main legislative body. The preparation and implementation of legislation takes place in the Federal Government or in the Provincial Governments. Legislative tasks are carried out at federal level by the National Assembly in conjunction with the Federal Council.  The Federal Council represents the interests of the provinces in Parliament. Provincial Assemblies (Landtage) represent the interests of citizens in the individual provinces. Each federal province is administered by a Provincial Government, which is headed by a Provincial Governor (Landeshauptmann) elected by the respective Provincial Assembly.  The Federal Government One of the Federal Government’s tasks is to prepare draft legislation, which is then submitted to Parliament. The Federal Government is headed by the Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) who, along with the Vice Chancellor, federal ministers and state secretaries, conducts government business.  The administration of justice The administration of justice in Austria proceeds from the federal level. Court judgments and decisions are pronounced and published in the name of the Republic. Judges are independent in the exercise of their office. Proceedings in courts of civil and criminal law are verbal and public. The final court of appeal for civil and criminal proceedings is the Supreme Court.  The judiciary is separate from the executive at all levels of jurisdiction. The police, as an executive agency, are subject to the Republic of Austria.  As in other countries, there are four levels of judicial authority in Austria: district courts (Bezirksgericht); regional courts (Landesgericht); Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht); Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof).  The Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) deals with disputes in connection with decisions taken by the administrative authorities. The Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgericht) deals with actions against federal, provincial, regional or municipal authorities.",

Those wishing to vote by post file a request - electronically or in paper form - at least 52 days before election day. Postal voting applications must include proof of identity. The Ministry of Interior maintains a special voter register of postal voters, dispatches the ballots (not later than 40 days before the election day), and distributes returning envelopes with ballots to the respective special electoral precincts (up to 4,000 voters each) formed by the Ministry of Interior to handle returned overseas postal votes. Voters who applied electronically to vote by post are delivered the postal voting package electronically (by e-mail) and those who applied in paper form to vote by post are mailed out the postal voting package to their address abroad. Voters who are registered to postal vote, receive by post the voting envelope, a returnable envelope and instructions on the method of voting to their address abroad. Those voters who applied electronically are to print the ballot paper published on the website of the Ministry of Interior which he/she is to use for voting. Voters who applied in paper form receive a paper ballot with the other voting package materials. On one ballot, a voter marks which one of the candidates he/she prefers by circling the candidate's ordinal number. Any voter who spoils their postal ballot that was sent to him/her in paper form may print a new ballot from the website of the Ministry of Interior. The voter places the marked ballot in the voting envelope and places the sealed voting envelope in the official returnable envelope, which he/she sends to the Ministry of Interior. The return envelope is marked \"Vote by Mail\" and has the address of the Home Office as the addressee, the voter's address as the sender and a unique identification code. The voter pays the postage. To prevent multiple voting, voters with permanent residence in Slovakia (i.e. temporarily outside of Slovakia) who have voted by post are deleted from the voter lists, upon notification by the Ministry of Interior to the relevant municipality. Postal ballots must be received by 12:00 on the day before the election in order to be counted. The Ministry of Interior dispatches the postal ballots to the special electoral precinct commissions, which determine the results of postal voting on the day of the election starting at 6:00 pm.",

Upon issuing the absentee certificate the voter is deleted from the voter list of their own polling district. Proxy voting is not allowed. Electors are to vote in the order that they arrived to the polling station. At the polling station, the voter must present his or her identity card. The set of ballot papers with an empty envelope are given to the voter who signs the voter list before voting. The poll worker circles the consecutive number of the voter in the list. If the voter is not on the voter list but is at the polling station of his or her residence, he or she is to be added to the voter list. Voters are obliged to proceed to the polling booth to vote in secret. The voter votes for one candidate by circling the ordinal number of the candidate listed on the ballot paper. Replacement of a spoilt ballot paper is allowed; the voter places the spoiled ballot in the box for the unused ballots. The marked ballot is inserted in the envelope by the voter which is then placed by the voter in the ballot box. Physically disabled voters or voters who cannot read or write can be assisted by another voter (not by commission members) to mark the ballot, put it in the envelope and insert it in the ballot box. Both of these electors are to be instructed on the voting and warned about the offense of electoral corruption. Mobile voting at homes and institutions for health reasons is available, in which case secrecy of the vote is guaranteed.",

Taking into account the local conditions, information about the establishment of such polling stations is to be published. Precinct commissions formed at polling stations established outside the territory of the Russian Federation have the right to compile a list of voters before election day - based on written requests of eligible voters, and on election day - based on oral appeals from citizens of the Russian Federation who have come to the precinct commission, permanently residing outside the territory of the Russian Federation or on long-term business trips abroad. Only voters who did not have an opportunity to vote early inside the territory of the Russian Federation are entitled to be included on the list of voters at the respective embassy or consulate and to vote abroad. The manner and procedure of in-person voting at out-of-country polling stations is the same as for in-person voting within the territory of the Russian Federation. ",

Voters who will be outside their locality of residence on election day can apply in advance to vote at a polling station in their temporary location. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. Proxy voting is prohibited. Ballot papers are issued to voters included in the voter list upon presentation of an internal passport or document that replaces a citizen's passport. Before issuing the ballot paper to a voter, the precinct election commission is obliged to check that the voter has not already voted early (for example, by portable ballot box in remote areas) or by mobile (homebound) voting. A voter who is not on the voter list for any reason can be registered on election day, upon showing a passport or other proof of residence at the polling station. Upon receipt of the ballot, the identification document number of the voter is to be entered into the voter list. The voter checks the accuracy of the entry made and both the voter and the poll worker sign the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. The voter should enter the polling booth (or other specially equipped place for secret voting) to mark the ballot. Voters should vote alone, except a voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can request assistance of another person who is not a poll worker, partisan representative, or observer. The voter using assistance must notify the precinct election commission and the personal details of the helper are to be entered in the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. Using any mark, the voter marks the ballot with any sign in the box relating to the candidate in whose favor the choice was made, or in the case of only one candidate on the ballot, to the position \"For\" or \"Against\". A voter who spoils a ballot can receive a replacement one from the poll worker, who records the issuance of a replacement ballot in the voter list next to the voter's name and signs the entry along with the secretary of the precinct election commission. The voters put the marked ballot into the sealed ballot box. If the Central Election Commission makes a decision to use ballot envelopes, the voter is to place the marked ballot into the envelope given to him/her by the poll worker after leaving the polling booth, and places the envelope in the ballot box. Electronic voting and counting machines may be available at polling stations.   Mobile (homebound) voting is available, upon advance application, for voters who, due to health reasons, disability, caring for a person in need, or other reasons, cannot go to the polling station. The Central Election Commission may decide to carry out voting outside the designated polling stations, including in public areas, for public health reasons and to facilitate voting, in the manner and within an established time frame set by the commission, not earlier than seven days before election day (however, this option does not apply if multiple-day voting is used).",

In addition, any voter who for a good reason (vacation, business trip, work, and educational activities, performance of state and public duties, state of health, and other valid reasons) will be absent from his/her place of residence and will not be able to arrive at the polling station where he/she is included on the list of voters must be given the opportunity to vote early but no earlier than 10 days before election day. With respect to the latter category, the voter who wishes to vote early must submit an application and indicate the reason for the need to vote early. However, the legislation does not require the voter to show proof of the reason for the absence on election day.  ",

The government consists of the Prime Minister, deputy prime ministers, and federal ministers and their ministries and departments. The Prime Minister submits to the President nominations for all subordinate Government positions, including deputy prime ministers, and federal ministers.  The President is directly elected under a two-round system in a single nationwide constituency for a six-year period.  Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Federal Assembly. The 450 members of the lower house - State Duma - are elected  for a term of five years, with parallel voting. Half of the seats (225) are elected by closed party-list proportional representation within a single nationwide constituency, with a five per cent electoral threshold, with the other half elected in 225 single-member constitutencies by first-past-the-post voting.  Regional assemblies with their respective deputies are formed through this system. The upper chamber - Federation Council - is not directly elected; each of the 85 federal subjects of Russia (oblasts, republics, autonomous territories, and autonomous okrugs) sends two delegates to the Federal Council, for a total of 170 members.  The judiciary of Russia is topped by the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Supreme Court of Arbitration.  The judiciary is governed by the All-Russian Congress of Judges and its Council of Judges.",

Executive power is nominally exercised by the government, at its top sits a ceremonial prime minister, appointed directly by the President.  Legislative power is de jure vested in the bicameral parliament, the National Assembly. The 110 members of the lower House of Representatives are directly elected for five-year terms under a majoritarian system in single-member constituencies. The Council of the Republic is the upper chamber of territorial representation, its members elected at meetings of the local councils of deputies and the City of Minsk, plus eight members appointed by the President of the Republic.  The Constitutional Court is the highest court in Belarus which deals with matters involving the Constitution and legality of certain laws passed by the government.

The president is assisted by two vice presidents.  The parliament consists of the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly normally has 210 members, all of whom are directly elected. For the first two parliaments elected after the promulgation of the 2013 constitution, however, the National Assembly has 270 seats, with the 60 additional seats reserved for women—6 from each of the 8 provinces and the 2 cities with provincial status—elected through a system of proportional representation. The Senate comprises 80 members: 60 (6 from each of the 8 provinces and the 2 cities with provincial status) elected by a party-list system of proportional representation, with men and women being listed alternately on every list; 16 traditional chiefs elected by the provincial assemblies of chiefs in the 8 provinces; 2 seats for the president and deputy president of the National Council of Chiefs (the administrative body of traditional chiefs); and 2 representatives of people with disabilities. All parliament members serve five-year terms.  The highest courts of the Zimbabwean judiciary are the Supreme Court (5 judges) and Constitutional Court (7 judges). Supreme Court judges may serve until age 70, while Constitutional Court judges serve a single 15-year term.  Judges from both courts are appointed by the President.",

They shall not exceed 750 in number, plus the President (currently there are 705 representatives which has increased to 720 for the 2024 elections). Representation of citizens shall be degressively proportional, with a minimum of six members and a maximum 96 members per State. The members must be elected  by either proportional list representation, with closed or open lists, or by single-transferable vote, which varies among the Member States. The Parliament, (equally) together with the Council of the European Union, which is composed of 27 national ministers (one per Member State) adopts European legislation, following a proposal by the European Commission (the executive).  The European Commission serves as the executive branch of the Union, accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve (by simple majority) the European Council's nominee for President of the Commission, and is further mandated with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole (the Commissioners are proposed by the President). The Parliament can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting (by two-thirds majority) a motion of censure.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ensures the uniform application and interpretation of European law and has the power to decide legal disputes between member states, the institutions, businesses and individuals.",

Early voting outside Iceland shall take place at the office of an Icelandic embassy, the office of an Icelandic consulate or the office of an Icelandic honorary consul, as further decided by the minister with the portfolio for foreign affairs.\n\nA voter wishing to cast a ballot in early voting shall identify him- or herself to the presiding officer by producing a personal identification document bearing the voter’s name, personal identification number and photograph, such as a passport, driving licence or identity card, or by other means deemed satisfactory by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall make a mark in the electoral register indicating who is casting a vote at the presiding officer’s station.\nFollowing the recording thereof, the voter shall be given the voting materials. The voter shall then, without assistance and without anyone seeing, write his or her vote on the ballot paper.\nThe voter shall then place the ballot in the ballot envelope and carefully glue the top flap together. Next, the voter shall address and sign the covering letter in the presence of the presiding officer, who shall witness the casting of the vote by signing the covering letter and, if applicable, stamp it with an official seal.\nVoters are entitled to be assisted when casting their ballots. Such assistance shall be provided by the presiding officer or an assistant accompanying the voter to the polling station. Assistance shall only be given if the voter him- or herself can tell the person providing the assistance how the voter wishes to cast the ballot. The voter’s assistant must abide by the instructions of the voter and shall be bound by a duty of confidentiality not to disclose what passes between the assistant and the voter in the polling booth. A candidate or a candidate’s spouse, children, siblings and parents are not permitted to assist with voting. A voter’s assistant is not permitted to become an assistant to more than three voters in the same poll.\nFinally, the ballot paper envelope together with the covering letter shall be placed inside the sending envelope, which shall then be carefully closed. The envelope shall then be addressed to the electoral commission in the municipality where the voter believes he or she is registered on the electoral register. The voter’s personal identification number shall be written on the back of the postal envelope.

The Finnish diplomatic missions and their offices at which out-of-country voters can vote are determined by a government decree.  The ballot, ballot envelope, covering letter form, and envelope for the covering letter form provided by the Ministry of Justice are used for out-of-country voting. A voter who wishes to vote in at a diplomatic mission shall report to the election official at the location.  The voter is obliged to present a proof of his or her identity to the election official. Thereafter, he or she is given a ballot, a ballot envelope and a covering envelope and, if needed, a covering letter form.  The voter shall be provided with the opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the master list of candidates for his or her electoral district. A voter in parliamentary elections has the right to vote for a candidate in the master list of candidates for the electoral district in which the voter is registered.  The voter shall mark the number of the candidate he or she is voting for in the ballot in such a manner that there can be no uncertainty as to whom he or she has voted for. The marking shall be made in the voting booth or somewhere else in a manner that maintains the election secrecy.  A person whose ability to mark the ballot is essentially weakened may request assistance from an election official, or can use the help of an assistant he or she has chosen. A candidate or his or her family member cannot assist voters. The assistant must strictly comply with the directions of the voter and keep secret the choice of the voter. The covering letter,which includes the name and identifying number of the voter, shall be addressed to the central electoral committee of that municipality and entered in the voter register next to the voter.  The voter shall sign a declaration on the covering letter stating that he or she himself or herself has, maintaining the election secrecy, filled in the ballot and enclosed it stamped in the ballot envelope. The voter shall give the folded ballot to the election official to be stamped and, immediately after the ballot is stamped, enclose it in the ballot envelope in front of the election authority. The closed ballot envelope and the signed covering letter are to be given to the election official. When a voter register is used in the advance polling station, the election official  shall check in the register that the voter has the right to vote, make an entry in the register indicating that the voter has used his or her right to vote, and make a marking on the covering letter indicating that an entry has been made in the voter register. When the voter register is not used at the polling location, a list of voters shall be kept.  The election offiical of a Finnish ship must deliver without delay the covering envelopes to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to a Finnish diplomatic mission in the country where the ship is or where it first arrives. The election official in a Finnish diplomatic mission, or, if the mission does not serve as an advance polling station, the Head of Mission, shall ensure that the covering envelopoes that have been given there or that have arrived there are delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a manner determined by it. The Ministry shall ensure that the covering envelopes are delivered without delay to the central electoral commitee of the municipality in question.  An eligible out-of-country voter wishing to vote by post shall order the postal voting documents online from the Ministry of Justice to be sent to an address abroad. The postal voting documents can be ordered three months before the election day at the earliest, which is October 28, 2023 for the 2024 Presidential election. An assistant may be used for placing the order. The voter's name and personal identity code and the postal address abroad to which the documents will be sent must be given with the order. The postal voting package includes a ballot, a postal ballot envelope in which the ballot is inserted, a postal vote covering letter, which the voter must fill in, a postal vote covering envelope, in which the ballot envelope and the covering letter are inserted, and postal voting instructions, drawn up by the Ministry of Justice. The first possible date for postal voting for the 2024 Presidential election is December 21, 2023, when the candidates and their candidate numbers will be confirmed. The eligible voter himself or herself must find out the number of the candidate that he or she wants to vote for (which are published about one month before the election day). The instructions to vote are as follows: First, the voter marks the number of the candidate he or she wants to vote for on the ballot, inserts the ballot in the postal ballot envelope, and seals the envelope. Next, the voter fills in the postal vote covering letter and signs it. Postal voters are obliged to mark the ballot and put it into the ballot envelope personally and in secret and maintaining electoral freedom. The voter must sign an attestation concerning this on the covering letter. Two witnesses must be present when the postal voting takes place. The witnesses must also sign the attestation on the covering letter stating that election secrecy has been preserved and electoral freedom respected while voting. The witnesses must have reached the age of 18. The spouse, child, or parent of the voter or an election candidate or his or her family member cannot be a witness. The witnesses need not be Finnish citizens. At the end of the postal voting, the voter puts the ballot envelope and the covering letter into the covering envelope and seals it. The name and address of the central municipal election board to which the vote will be sent must be visible in the window of the covering envelope. The voter must send the covering envelope, containing the ballot sealed in the ballot envelope and the covering letter, to Finland to the central municipal election board of the municipality in which the voter has the right to vote according to the voter register. The voter is responsible to find out which municipality this is by calling the relevant authorities or if the voter received a polling card, by using the address indicated on it. The voter must put enough postage on the covering envelope (the mailing is not pre-paid). Finally, the voter posts the covering envelope to Finland through the postal service of a foreign country in the same manner as any other postal item.  The voter may also choose to post the envelope as a registered letter or to use an international courier service. For the first round of the 2024 Presidential election, the postal vote must arrive at the central municipal election board of the municipality of the voter's residence by 19:00 on January 26, 2024.",

      "details": "The new constitution submitted to referendum largely reproduces the text of the 1996 Constitution. Unlike the 2018 Constitution, the latter benefits from a better image, being the fruit of numerous consultations that led to a consensus during the Sovereign National Conference organised in 1993.  The text of this new fundamental law - the eleventh since the country's independence in 1960 - marks a return to a semi-presidential system, replacing the presidential system of 2018 by confirming the restoration of the post of Prime Minister as head of government accountable to the National Assembly, distinct from the role of Head of State of the President of the Republic. The President's term of office will be reduced from six to five years, always renewable once consecutively. The minimum age for presidential candidates is lowered from 40 to 35. The draft constitution also ratifies the existence of the Senate, which was theoretically created by the 2018 constitution but has never yet been set up, as well as the division of the country into 23 regions, or provinces.  The text is also notable for its objective of restoring a number of rights, concepts and democratic institutions that had been removed from the 1996 text by a succession of constitutional revisions under the presidency of Idriss Déby. Independence of the judiciary has been consolidated by assigning the chairmanship of the High Council of the Judiciary not to the President of the Republic but to the President of the Supreme Court, who was previously second vice-president. The High Court of Justice, placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2018, has also regained its independence as an institution, and the sole power to try for high treason the President of the Republic, those of other institutions, as well as members of the government and their possible accomplices.The same applies to the Constitutional Council, which regains its independence from the Supreme Court and exercises sole control over the constitutionality of laws, organic laws, decrees and international treaties.Its review is carried out automatically before they are promulgated, but also a posteriori on the basis of a dispute referred to the Council by an ordinary court.The Council also judges electoral disputes and administers the oath of office to the newly elected President of the Republic.  In terms of military justice, a Court of Appeal was created, in addition to the military courts and the Supreme Court.",

The President is directly elected by absolute majority vote in up to two rounds and may serve two 5-year terms. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Sejm.  Poland has a bicameral Parliament composed of a 100-seat Senate and a 460-seat Sejm. Senators are directly elected by plurality vote in single-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Members of the Sejm are directly elected by party-list proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties must earn at least 5% of the national vote to gain a seat in the Sejm, and coalitions must earn 8% of the vote with minority parties excepted from this standard.  Poland has two high courts: the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is composed of 121 judges separated into thematic chambers. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the National Judicial Council and confirmed by the President, and they may serve until age 65. The Constitutional Tribunal is composed of 15 judges appointed by the Sejm to serve a 9-year term.",

The overseas voter register is permanent, so that voters do not need to register anew for each election. Registered out-of-country electors may also designate a proxy upon application to the mayor of The Hague at least six weeks before the polling day. Registered postal voter receive a postal vote certificate (not a voting pass) as proof of being allowed to vote by post. The postal voting packages are mailed out to out-of-country voters. Postal voters have the option of downloading their postal ballot electronically but must mark and cast the ballots in hard copy. To allow for voters to print the ballot themselves, in past elections the postal ballot was much smaller than the in-person ballot, with numbers for places on the list but not all the candidates' names. The postal voting package includes the ballot, the ballot envelope, the return envelope with the pre-printed return address, a postal vote certificate containing a declaration to be signed by the person that he or she has personally completed the ballot paper, and voting instructions. In the return envelope, voters send back the ballot in the ballot envelope, as well as signed postal vote certificate, which they received separately. The postal voter colours the white spot in front of the name/number of the candidate of her or his choice, in red, blue or black. The ballot is then folded and put in the ballot envelope. The voter then signs the postal vote certificate declaring that he or she has completed the ballot paper personally. The voter encloses a copy of an approved identity document, which must be valid.  The postal ballot certificate, copy of ID, and envelope containing the ballot paper are then placed in the accompanying return envelope which is closed and returned (with adequate stamps). The postal ballots can be mailed to The Hague municipality or dropped off at a designated Dutch diplomatic or consular mission or other overseas location serving as a collection point for votes abroad, Dutch representations at the Carribean countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, or collection points designated by the Ministry of Defence at military missions outside The Netherlands. The votes handed in to these collection points are counted at the collection points and the results transmitted electronically to The Hague district election committee. The oveseas ballots are counted by the The Hague district election committee and count in the results of The Hague municipality.",

        "instructions": "Everyone eligible to vote will receive an invitation to cast their vote sent to their home address no later than 14 days prior to election day. This invitation includes the voter's poll card (voting pass) which allows the voter to cast their vote in the polling station of their choice within the borders of the municipality in which he or she is registered. The poll card (voting pass) is a personalized document with security features against copying. Voters can request a replacement in case of loss, including on election day. Voters may also request, by written or oral application to the  municipality where he or she is registered, to vote at any other location in the country, in which case they are issued a voter's (absentee) pass. Such requests in writing must be received no later than five days before polling day or in case of oral request, by 12 noon on the day before voting.  Municipal authorities can set up mobile polling stations that move from designated location to designated location on election day during certain times. Any voter unable to cast their vote in person on election day, including voters residing abroad, may appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. No justification is required to request a proxy vote, but voters cannot request a proxy in a polling station. Appointing a proxy may be done by simply providing the chosen proxy who resides in the same municipality with a signed voting pass or voter's (absentee) pass. A proxy residing outside the voter's municipality may be authorized through an application to the mayor received no later than five days before the polling day, in which case a certificate of authorization is issued to the proxy. A proxy may cast the additional vote in a polling station only together with her or his vote, upon presentation of the signed voting or voter's pass and (copy of) the identification document of the represented person. One person can be the proxy of only up to two persons. Prisoners can only vote by proxy. All voters casting votes must show an authorized identification document to the poll worker. Any such identification may not have expired by more than five years. The voter must also hand in his/her poll card (voting pass) or voter's (absentee) pass to the poll worker before voting. Upon doing so, the poll worker checks that the voting pass has not been invalidated (according to the list of invalid passes) and that it corresponds to the identity document. If the pass is not on the invalid list and the pass and identification correspond then the voter is issued a ballot paper and the poll worker directs the voter  to the polling booth. The poll worker retains and cancels the voting pass. Proxy voters who have a certificate of authorization are to hand it over to the poll worker. Polling stations do not keep voters lists (the retention of voting passes prevents multiple voting.) The polling booths must have instructions on voting, established by ministerial order. Voters are required to mark the ballot in secret in the polling booth with a red pencil.  In each electoral district, votes are cast for the candidates whose names appear on the lists of candidates for that electoral district. Voters can vote for a list or have the option to cast a preferential vote for a candidate of choice.  The voter colours in the white spot opposite the name of the candidate of her or his choice. The voter then folds the ballot paper, leaves the polling booth, and inserts the ballot in the ballot box next to the electoral committee's table. If the voter does not put the ballot in the box, the chairperson shall make a note of it. If a voter makes a mistake when completing the ballot paper, he or she can return it to the chairperson and, on request, will be provided (once) with a new ballot paper. The law provides that if a voter requires help because of her or his physical condition, the electoral committee should allow him or her to avail themself of assistance.  Voters are allowed to remain in the polling station while the electoral committee is in session, provided they do not create a disturbance or hinder the progress of the session.",

Overseas voting will takeplace in person at polling stations which will be set up in embassies, consulates and suitable venues of Greek disaspora organizations. For an out-of-country polling station to be constituted, a minimum of 40 registered voters is required. On the day appointed for voting, voters come to the polling station of the relevant electoral division and present themselves to the electoral commitee, which determines their identity based on their Greeck police ID or Greek passport, and verifies their registration in the foreign voter list. To each voter, the electoral committee delivers an envelope initialed by the representative of the judicial authority and sealed with a stamp of the committee, a complete set of ballot forms and a blank ballot. Then the voter proceeds to the special separate area, in such a way that he/she cannot be seen, and there the voter secretly inserts the ballot paper of his choosing in the envelope given to him/her by the election committee. After securely sealing the envelope, the voter returns to the election committee and shows the envelope to the members and other attendees, to show that he/she is holding only one envelope, and then inserts the envelope into the ballot box. The election committee draws up minutes during the voting for every matter related to its conduct.\n\nThe 2023 elections will be the first time that certain out-of-country Greek citizens will be able to vote abroad.  According to legislation adopted in December 2019, after the 2019 parliamentary elections,  registered voters who are temporarily or permanently abroad must fulfil two main requirements in order to vote abroad. They must have had a two-year stay in Greece in the last 35 years and for those over 30 years old they  must have filed  a tax return in Greece in the year of the election or the preceding year.",

The voter must place the chosen and marked ballot papers within the specially marked envelope and seal it, then proceed to show the sealed and stamped envelope to the chairperson of the returning board and others present, and then the voter places the envelope in the ballot box. Voters physically incapable of performing such tasks can request the court representative or a member of the returning board for obligatory assistance.  For the constituency voting, voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking the candidate's name on the party ballot.  Upon request, voters will be provided with a certificate signed by the chairperson of the returning board and bearing its stamp that he/she voted. The returning board keeps a protocol in which the electors who vote are written.",

The Prime Minister is appointed by the Amir, as is the Crown Prince, who also must be approved by the National Assembly. The Crown Prince is also designated as the Heir Apparent and the National Assembly must swear fealty to the Crown Prince.   Kuwait has a unicameral National Assembly (Majlis al-Umma), which has 50 members and 15 ex-officio seats reserved for cabinet ministers. Per the Constitution, there may be more ministers (and thus ex-officio members) so long as the number of ministers does not exceed one-third of the total assembly.   The highest courts in Kuwait are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. All judges are appointed by the Amir on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council. ",

Only election-related officials (polling staff and the police), the elderly (those over 70 years old), disabled or illiterate persons who need extra time and assistance in the voting process, those on remand, and voters travelling on election day, can vote on the advance polling day. Persons wanting to vote on the advance polling day must submit an application in writing to be witnessed by a person holding certain positions (e.g., justice of the peace, medical doctor, lawyer, etc., or a person of similar standing as approved by the Supervisor of Elections) and who has known the applicant personally for at least two years. Persons who will be travelling in advance of polling day are to include his/her travel ticket with the application as proof of travel. It is expected, however, that a bill is to be laid before the House of Assembly to include other categories of voters to be allowed to vote on Advance Polling Day which is to be effective for the 2023 election.\n\nOn the advance polling day, voters vote in the same manner and according to the same procedures that apply on election day.  At the close of the advance poll, the presiding officer shall, in addition to various reconciliation procedures, ensure that the ballot papers remain in their boxes, seal the ballot boxes with seals provided by the Supervisor of Elections, close the poll on the electronic tabulation system (if utilized) and run the paper tape, remove the media stick placing it with the printed report in a designated pouch, seal the pouch and place it in a second sealed pouch which is placed with other election materials in a designated carrying case. The ballots cast at the advance poll and the carrying case with election materials are then submitted to the Supervisor of Elections for safe keeping until election day when they are delivered to the presiding officers.",

Voters can apply in advance to transfer their voter registration from one electoral district to another. Upon entering the polling station, the voter must present their voter registration card or Government issued ID to the poll clerk, and the poll clerk then ascertains that the voter's name is on the voter list or electronic poll book for that polling station. The poll clerk then enters the voter's name and corresponding number from the voter list into the poll book. The voter is then allowed to immediately vote unless the election official or any candidate agent present desires that the voter first be sworn. The presiding officer issues to the voter a ballot paper that has a detachable counterfoil attached with a number printed on the face of the ballot paper and has the poll clerks initials on the back. The presiding officer instructs the voter to mark the ballot with an \"X\" or to shade the designated oval sign, by referring the voter to a speciman ballot paper posted in a conspicuous place. The voter then immediately proceeds to vote in secret in a polling booth where the ballot is marked as instructed. The voter marks the ballot for up to five candidates - one vote in the local electoral district and up to four votes in the territorial-at-large district. Voters with a physical disability or blindness, or who are illiterate, may be assisted by the presiding officer to cast the ballot, upon the swearing of the required oath by such persons. After voting, the voter returns the ballot paper to the presiding officer, folded as instructed. In full view of all present, the presiding officer then removes the counterfoil and directs the voter to insert the ballot into the locked ballot box or into the electronic tabulation machine (ballot scanner), if being used at that polling station. If the voter inadvertently spoils the ballot paper, the presiding officer can issue another ballot paper and writes or stamps \"spoiled\" on the face of the spoiled ballot. The poll clerk then enters next to the voter's name in the (electronic) poll book, the word \"voted\". If at any point a voter has taken an oath or affirmation or refused to take an oath or affirm or to answer any question that the voter is legally required to do, this is to be noted in the (electronic) poll book. After voting, the voter must immediately leave the polling station.",

Submitting a written or electronic application for voting outside the country in the elections for national representatives is not mandatory.

However, polling commission members and security officers are allowed to vote at the polling station of their duty; students are entitled to vote in the  municipality where they study; and persons with disabilitiles may vote in any suitable polling station of their choice without submitting a prior request. Up until 14 days before election day, candidates, higher level election officials, and accredited observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency. Up until 14 days before election day, any voter can request inclusion in the voter lists at the place of their current (temporary) registered residence. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. In polling stations with at least 300 registered voters, the voters have the option to use either paper ballot voting or direct recording electronic voting machines.  If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting screen and in private marks the square of the candidate list of his/her choice and if so wishes, also marks the circle of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, leaves the screen and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list and if he/she chooses, also for a candidate on the list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and the voted ballot is printed and the voter proceeds to cast the printed ballot in the same way as the paper ballots are cast. The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.  The mobile voting is carried out by not less than four poll workers on election day.",

Bulgaria has a unicameral National Assembly (Народно събрание / Narodno Sabranie) with 240 seats. Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

The Spanish judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court (president and 79 judges organized into thematic chambers) and the Constitutional Court (12 judges). Supreme Court judges are nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary Power (CGPJ) and appointed by the King. These judges may serve until they are 70 years old.

Senators serve 4-year terms and are directly elected by plurality vote in multi-seat constituencies (208 seats) or indirectly elected by autonomous community legislatures (57 seats). Deputies serve 4-year terms and are directly elected via closed-list proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies (348 seats) or directly elected by plurality vote (2 seats in Ceuta and Melilla).  The Spanish judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court (president and 79 judges organized into thematic chambers) and the Constitutional Court (12 judges). Supreme Court judges are nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary Power (CGPJ) and appointed by the King. These judges may serve until they are 70 years old. Constitutional Court judges are nominated by the legislature, president, and CGPJ and appointed by the King to serve 9-year terms.",

The number and offices of the overseas polling stations  are determined by the minister of foreign affairs in consultation with the National Election Commission, on the basis of establishing a polling station where there are at least 15 registered voters and establishing at least one polling station within the territorial responsiblity of the consultate to facilitate postal voting. Voters living abroad and holding a valid Polish passport (or valid ID in countries where Polish citizens can enter with only a Polish ID card) can be entered into the voter list compiled by the respective consulate, based on personal application lodged verbally, in writing, or by phone, fax or electronically. The foreign ministry, in consultaton with the National Election Commission, is to issue a regulation that will ensure that an overseas voter is entered on only one voter list.  Voters in possession of an absentee voting certificate issued in Poland can vote abroad at any polling station.  Citizens permanently living abroad can be entered on the voter list of a consultate on election, provided the voter presents proof of permament residence abroad in which case the commission places its seal and date of votong on the free page of the passport dedicated to visas and enters the passport number and validity date in the remarks section of the voter list.  The in-person oveseas voting process is the same as for in-country voting, except for the Polish passport requirement in countries where Polish citizens cannot enter without a passport and proxy voting is not permitted in overseas voting. For overseas postal voting, the voting package includes an addressed return envelope, the ballot paper(s), a ballot paper envelope, a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote, and voting instructions. The postal voter is to mark the ballot, and insert the marked ballot into the ballot paper envelope, seal the envelope and insert it into the return envelope together with the signed declaration (a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote) and return it by mail at his or her own cost to the address of the consul. Voters can also deliver the postal vote in the envelope in person to the respective consul.

Citizens  who will be out of the country on election day can apply for an absentee voting certificate and vote at any polling station abroad.  There are 402 overseas polling places. Overseas voters can cast votes in-person at polling stations established at embassies/consulates (and possible other locations) or, 15 days before the election day, can apply for postal voting to the respective consul and receive a voting package sent out not later than 10 days before election day.  The number and offices of the overseas polling stations  are determined by the minister of foreign affairs in consultation with the National Election Commission, on the basis of establishing a polling station where there are at least 15 registered voters and establishing at least one polling station within the territorial responsiblity of the consultate to facilitate postal voting. Voters living abroad and holding a valid Polish passport (or valid ID in countries where Polish citizens can enter with only a Polish ID card) can be entered into the voter list compiled by the respective consulate, based on personal application lodged verbally, in writing, or by phone, fax or electronically. The foreign ministry, in consultaton with the National Election Commission, is to issue a regulation that will ensure that an overseas voter is entered on only one voter list.  Voters in possession of an absentee voting certificate issued in Poland can vote abroad at any polling station.  Citizens permanently living abroad can be entered on the voter list of a consultate on election, provided the voter presents proof of permament residence abroad in which case the commission places its seal and date of votong on the free page of the passport dedicated to visas and enters the passport number and validity date in the remarks section of the voter list.  The in-person oveseas voting process is the same as for in-country voting, except for the Polish passport requirement in countries where Polish citizens cannot enter without a passport and proxy voting is not permitted in overseas voting. For overseas postal voting, the voting package includes an addressed return envelope, the ballot paper(s), a ballot paper envelope, a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote, and voting instructions. The postal voter is to mark the ballot, and insert the marked ballot into the ballot paper envelope, seal the envelope and insert it into the return envelope together with the signed declaration (a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote) and return it by mail at his or her own cost to the address of the consul. Voters can also deliver the postal vote in the envelope in person to the respective consul. The consul transfers all returned envelopes that it received by the end of voting time to the appropriate election commission.",

Until voter lists are finalized, voters can apply to obtain an Absentee Voting Certficate, enabling them to vote at any polling station. These voters are removed from the voter list in their place of residence and added to the supplementary voter list of the precinct where the vote was cast on election day. On the day of voting, the precinct election commission can add omitted persons to the voter list with proof of permanent residence on the territory of the given voting circuit, provided that the office of the municipality has confirmed that it has not received a notice of this person’s forfeiture of the right to vote or notice of the inclusion of that person on the roll of voters of another voting circuit. Proxy voting is prohibited except that voters with a significant or moderate degree of disability within the meaning of the law or who are over 60 can formally give another person their proxy vote (a proxy vote can be taken only from one person or two if immediate family member, and cannot be given to election commission members or partisan agents). Upon arrival at the polling station, a voter must provide proof of identity to the election commission. A stamped ballot paper is issued and the voter confirms receipt with his/her signature on the voter list. The voter must mark the ballot in the polling booth that guarantees secrecy. For Sejm elections, the voter must vote for only one candidate list with an \"X\" in the box to the left side next to the name of one of the candidates from this list, which indicates this candidates priority in obtaining the mandate; for Senat elections, the voter puts an \"X\" in the box to the left of the chosen candidate. The voter inserts the ballot in the ballot box located in a visible position, in such a way that the printed side of ballot is not visible. Upon request by a disabled voter, another person who is not a poll worker or partisan observer can assist the voter to vote. ",

Parties must earn at least 5% of the national vote to gain a seat in the Sejm, and coalitions must earn 8% of the vote with minority parties excepted from this standard.  Poland has two high courts: the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is composed of 121 judges separated into thematic chambers. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the National Judicial Council and confirmed by the President, and they may serve until age 65.

Electors vote first in the primary elections among their chiefdom's candidates and then on another day in the secondary elections among the winning chiefdom candidates within that constituency. Voting is only in person. On arrival at the polling station, a voter presents his/her voter ID card to an election official. The official then checks for the voter's name in the voter register. If the voter is registered but does not have a voter card, he/she must prove to the presiding officer that he/she is the one whose name appears on the voter register. The election official is also required to determine that the voter has not already voted in the election by checking that the voter's name is not marked off the voter register (in past elections, indelible ink on the index finger has also been used). Next, the election official issues the voter an ordinary ballot. A  tendered ballot is issued if the voter's name on the register is already marked as voted and the voter properly answers a set of specified questions and makes and signs a declaration that he/she has not already voted (the voter's registration number is put on the back of the tendered ballot and entered on the tendered ballots register).  The presiding officer can refuse to issue a ballot paper to the voter if an objection by declarationn on oath is made by a candidate, agent or voter on grounds that the person is impersonating a dead or incapacitated voter and the election officer is not satisfied of the person's claimed identity; the refusal can be appealed to the returning officer. Next, the election official calls out the number of the voter on the voter register, enters the number in the space provided on the counterfoil of the issued ballot, tears out the ballot paper and marks it with the official mark on the back of the ballot, folds the ballot paper in four so that the face of the ballot is on the inside and the official mark on the outside, then unfolds it and hands it to the voter, and draws a line in red ink through the number and name or photograph of the voter in the voter register as evidence that the ballot has been issued. Voting is by secret ballot in both primary and secondary elections. The voter goes immediately with the ballot paper to an unoccupied polling booth and in secret puts a marks on the picture of one candidate of his/her choice. The voter then folds the ballot so that the face of it is on the inside and places it in the respective ballot box. If the election officer has any doubt that the ballot was not the one issued at the polling station, he/she may require the voter to show the presiding officer the number and official mark on the back of the ballot paper before it is inserted in the ballot box.  Tendered ballots are placed the presiding officer in a separate envelope. Any voter who is illiterate or has a physical disability can request the presiding officer to assist or to allow a person accompanying that voter to assist him/her cast a ballot. The assisting person is bound to keep the secrecy of the vote. The presiding officer is to record in the voter register that the voter has been assisted by him/her or an accompanying person and the reason for doing so. A voter who inadvertently spoils his/his ballot paper may return it to the presiding officer for a new ballot paper. After voting, a voter must immediately leave the polling station.",

These seats are elected by members of the Assembly.  The judiciary is comprised of the Supreme Court (which has a chief justice and at least 4 justices) and the High Court. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all constitutional matters. Justices of both courts are appointed by the monarch with the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. ",

For the first two parliaments elected after the promulgation of the 2013 constitution, however, the National Assembly has 270 seats, with the 60 additional seats reserved for women—6 from each of the 8 provinces and the 2 cities with provincial status—elected through a system of proportional representation. The Senate comprises 80 members: 60 (6 from each of the 8 provinces and the 2 cities with provincial status) elected by a party-list system of proportional representation, with men and women being listed alternately on every list; 16 traditional chiefs elected by the provincial assemblies of chiefs in the 8 provinces; 2 seats for the president and deputy president of the National Council of Chiefs (the administrative body of traditional chiefs); and 2 representatives of people with disabilities. All parliament members serve five-year terms.  The highest courts of the Zimbabwean judiciary are the Supreme Court (5 judges) and Constitutional Court (7 judges). Supreme Court judges may serve until age 70, while Constitutional Court judges serve a single 15-year term.  Judges from both courts are appointed by the President.",

A bio-metric verification system or other technologies to verify identity in addition to the ID card may be used, but failure to provide identify through the new technology cannot disentitle the voter to cast a vote if otherwise entitled to do so. Before the ballot paper is issued to a voter, the number and name of the voter on the electoral roll is to be called out and struck off. Indelible ink is to be put on the finger or thumb of either hand of the voter. The ballot paper is to be stamped on its back with the official mark and signed by the presiding officer. The presiding officer will also record, on the counterfoil of the ballot paper, the number of the voter on the electoral roll and the number of the voter's ID card, stamp and sign the counter foil, and obtain the thumb impression of the voter on the counterfoil. The voter must also put their thumb impression on the space provided on the electoral roll next to their photo. On receiving the ballot paper, the voter should proceed to the place reserved for marking the ballot paper; in secret, put the prescribed mark on the ballot paper at any place within the space containing the name/symbol of the candidate for whom he/she wishes to vote; and fold the ballot paper and insert it in the ballot box. The voter must immediately leave the polling station after voting. If a voter inadvertently spoils the ballot paper, he/she can obtain a replacement ballot from the presiding officer. Tendered ballot papers are used when a voter who presents himself/herself to vote but another voter is recorded to have voted in his/her place. A candidate or polling agent can challenge the identity of a voter who presents himself/herself or declare reasonable cause to believe that the voter has already voted at the same or another polling station. If the candidate/agent undertakes to prove the charge in court and makes a monetary deposit to the presiding officer, the officer is to issue the voter a 'challenged ballot paper'. When the voter marks the challenged ballot paper, the presiding officer places it in a separate packet instead of the ballot box.",

These envelopes are then put into the pre-addressed return envelope, sent to the court of first instance in Andorra. The postal voters is to include in the main envelope their certificate of registration on the final voter list and a photocopy of their passport. The envelope is to be closed and the voter is to put their name, address and signature on the back of the envelope. The voter is to return the package in the manner set out in the instructions.

The Cap de Govern serves 4-year terms.  Andorra's legislature, the unicameral General Council, has 28 members. Half of those members are elected by proportional representation vote in a single, nationwide constituency while the other half are elected by plurality vote in multi-seat constituencies (2 seats for each of 7 parishes). All members serve 4-year terms.  The Andorran judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice (9 judges) and the Constitutional Court (4 judges). Supreme Court judges are selected by a panel called the Supreme Council of Justice and serve 6-year terms. Constitutional judges are selected by the General Council and the co-princes, and they may serve up to two 8-year terms.",

Thereafter, he or she is given a ballot, a ballot envelope and a covering envelope and, if needed, a covering letter form.  The voter shall be provided with the opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the master list of candidates for his or her electoral district. A voter in parliamentary elections has the right to vote for a candidate in the master list of candidates for the electoral district in which the voter is registered.

The postal voting package includes a ballot, a postal ballot envelope in which the ballot is inserted, a postal vote covering letter, which the voter must fill in, a postal vote covering envelope, in which the ballot envelope and the covering letter are inserted, and postal voting instructions, drawn up by the Ministry of Justice. The eligible voter himself or herself must find out the number of the candidate that he or she wants to vote for (which are published about one month before the election day). The instructions to vote are as follows: First, the voter marks the number of the candidate he or she wants to vote for on the ballot, inserts the ballot in the postal ballot envelope, and seals the envelope. Next, the voter fills in the postal vote covering letter and signs it. Postal voters are obliged to mark the ballot and put it into the ballot envelope personally and in secret and maintaining electoral freedom. The voter must sign an attestation concerning this on the covering letter. Two witnesses must be present when the postal voting takes place. The witnesses must also sign the attestation on the covering letter stating that election secrecy has been preserved and electoral freedom respected while voting. The witnesses must have reached the age of 18. The spouse, child, or parent of the voter or an election candidate or his or her family member cannot be a witness. The witnesses need not be Finnish citizens. At the end of the postal voting, the voter puts the ballot envelope and the covering letter into the covering envelope and seals it. The name and address of the central municipal election board to which the vote will be sent must be visible in the window of the covering envelope. The voter must send the covering envelope, containing the ballot sealed in the ballot envelope and the covering letter, to Finland to the central municipal election board of the municipality in which the voter has the right to vote according to the voter register. The voter is responsible to find out which municipality this is by calling the relevant authorities or if the voter received a polling card, by using the address indicated on it. The voter must put enough postage on the covering envelope (the mailing is not pre-paid).

At a general advance polling station in Finland, the voting takes place at the times determined by a decision of the local executive, which may not be before 8:00 or after 20:00 on weekdays or before 10:00 or after 18:00 on Saturdays and Sundays. A voter who arrives at the advance polling station within the time frame specified but has not been able to cast a vote during that time may vote after the said time.\n\nEvery eligible voter may vote in advance at the general advance polling stations in Finland.\n\nThere must be at least one general advance polling station located in each municipality in Finland.  In addition, advance voting  is held n hospitals, full-time care facilities, and prisons for one or two days as determined by the electoral commission. Homebound voting also takes place during the advance polling days. The ballot, ballot envelope, covering letter form, and envelope for the covering letter form provided by the Ministry of Justice are used in advance voting.  A voter who wishes to vote in advance shall report to the election official or the electoral commission at the advance polling station. Where necessary, advance voting conducted in an institution is to be organized in different units and patients rooms. The voter is obliged to present a proof of his or her identity to the election official or the electoral commission. Thereafter, he or she is given a ballot, a ballot envelope and a covering envelope and, if needed, a covering letter form.  The voter shall be provided with the opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the master list of candidates for his or her electoral district. A voter in parliamentary elections has the right to vote for a candidate in the master list of candidates for the electoral district in which the voter is registered.  The voter shall mark the number of the candidate he or she is voting for in the ballot in such a manner that there can be no uncertainty as to whom he or she has voted for. The marking shall be made in the voting booth or somewhere else in a manner that maintains the election secrecy.  A person whose ability to mark the ballot is essentially weakened may request assistance from an election official or member of an electoral commission, or can use the help of an assistant he or she has chosen. A candidate or his or her family member cannot assist voters. The assistant must strictly comply with the directions of the voter and keep secret the choice of the voter. The covering letter,which includes the name and identifying number of the voter, shall be addressed to the central electoral committee of that municipality and is entered in the voting register next to the voter.  The voter shall sign a declaration on the covering letter stating that he or she himself or herself has, maintaining the election secrecy, filled in the ballot and enclosed it stamped in the ballot envelope. The voter shall give the folded ballot to the election official or, in an institution, to the electoral commission to be stamped and, immediately after the ballot is stamped, enclose it in the ballot envelope in front of the election authority. The closed ballot envelope and the signed covering letter are to be given to the election official or the electoral commission. When a voter register is used in the advance polling station, the election official or the chairperson of the electoral commission shall check in the register that the voter has the right to vote, make an entry in the register indicating that the voter has used his or her right to vote, and make a marking on the covering letter indicating that an entry has been made in the voter register. When the voter register is not used at the advance polling station, a list of voters shall be kept. The election official and the electoral commission of a general advance polling station in Finland shall ensure that the covering envelopes addressed to the municipality's own central electoral committee are without delay delivered to the central electoral committee in the manner determined by it.

        "instructions": "In order to vote, a voter must be registered in the register of electors in that constituency. Employers must provide four hours paid leave for voters to go to their polling station to vote. At their designated polling station, voters are required to present a voter identification card (issued by the Electoral Commission) to a polling official who checks off the name of the voter against the voter register and issues the voter with a ballot paper. Before handing the ballot to the voter, the voter is checked that he or she does not have the black electoral ink on the right index finger. If the voter is refused a ballot due to having such ink on his or her finger, the presiding officer must make an entry in the poll book setting out the facts of the refusal.  The polling official then puts the official stamp on the ballot paper, calls out the number, name and description of the voter as stated in the voter register, and instructs the voter how to fold the ballot. A presiding officer may, and if required by a candidate or polling agent must, put to a voter at the time of applying for a ballot paper specific questions regarding the identity of the voter and whether he or she has already voted. Only if the voter satisfactorily answers the questions, if asked, can he or she be  given a ballot paper. The voter then proceeds to the polling booth to vote in secret. Electors vote by putting a cross on the ballot paper against the name of the candidate they want to represent them (any other mark or comment on the paper renders it invalid), folds the ballot so as to conceal the vote, shows the back of the folded ballot paper to the presiding officer, so as to disclose the official stamp, and then inserts the ballot paper in a sealed box in the presence of the presiding officer. Prior to inserting the ballot in the box, the presiding officer must cause the voter to immerse his or her right index finger in the black electoral ink. If the voter refuses to do so, the presiding officer takes possession of and destroys the ballot paper. A voter who spoils his or her ballot paper can return it to the presiding officer who will issue a new ballot paper if satisified that it was mistakenly spoiled.   Blind voters and those with physical disabilities may be assisted to cast their vote through a regulated procedure. A voter must vote without undue delay and leave the polling station as soon as he or she has inserted the ballot in the box. The law allows proxy voting for those unable or likely to be unable to vote in person at the polling station for reason of providing law enforcement or defence service on election day or working as an election official or polling agent on election day.  Such person wishing to vote by proxy must submit an application not later than three days before election day to be treated as an \"absent voter\" and provide the name and address of a person within the country whom he or she wishes to act as proxy to him or her. A letter 'p' will be marked beside the voter's name in the voter register and a list of proxies is made for each polling station. At the polling station, a proxy must appear on the list of proxies and show that his or her left index finger does not have red electoral ink on it (different than the black in on the right index finger for regular voters). Upon a proxy receiving the ballot paper, a mark is to be placed by his or her name in the list of proxies. Prior to placing the ballot in the ballot box, a proxy is to immerse his or her left index finger in the indelible red ink. Election officials and polling agents may, in the alternative, apply in advance to be \"transferred\" to vote at the polling station to which they are assigned, in which case they are issued a transfer certificate. If a person who appears on the voter register or on a proxy list applies for a ballot paper after another person has voted in person either as the elector or proxy, the applicant is entitled to vote a \"tendered ballot\" provided he or she satisfactorily answers questions regarding his or her identity and whether he or she has already voted. Any marked tendered ballot is separately packaged and the name and electoral number of the voter recorded.",

Ten days before the election day, the embassies/consulates are to be provided with sufficient postal ballots for voters to pick up if requested. Voters who request postal ballots are to be struck off the signature list for that voter's regular polling place. Postal ballot packages include an official ballot, a ballot envelope, an affidavit, and a covering reply envelope. The postal voter marks the ballot in the usual manner provided by law and in secret. The voter then inserts the ballot in the envelope and securely seals the envelope. Then the voter completes and executes the affidavit. The ballot envelope and the affidavit are to be enclosed and sealed in the covering reply envelope . The envelope is to be posted to the national election commissioner of the state that issued the postal ballot or the voter can deliver the envelope to the embassy/consulate where he or she had requested the postal ballot, if he or she had done so. All postal ballots must be received by the national election commissioner or the embassy/consulate, as applicable, by the established closing hour of the polls on election day.

        "instructions": "In general, voters must vote at the polling place where they appear on the so-called signature list (essentially a voter list). However, voters who will be absent from their electoral district on election day but will be within their state can apply in writing not later than seven days before the election day to vote at any polling place within their state (their name will be deleted from the signature list of their regular polling place). Also, a voter who has a voter identification card may vote in any polling place within their state without having to submit a written request.  In addition, voters who will be outside of their state on election day but within the country can apply in writing not later than 30 days prior to the election day to vote at a special designated polling place in the state where they will be located on election day.  In certain circumstances, the 7-day and 30-day notice requirements can be waived, including if the person had applied in an earlier election for absentee voting in that same polling place on a default basis.  A person appearing at any regular or special polling place to vote shall report his or her full name to the election board members. If the person has been issued a voter identification card, he or she must present it to the election board members in order to vote. If the person has not been issued a voter identification card, then he or she shall present other proof of identity. An election board member checks the signature list  to determine whether or not the person appearing is a registered voter for that election district and if so, shall announce the name appearing on the list. Once the person's identity is established and entry has been found on the list, the voter shall sign his or her full name next to his or her entry on the list. An election board member issues the person an official ballot, and, if the person has presented a voter identification card, marks the card so as to indicate that the person has already voted. If a person's name does not appear on the signature list they cannot vote except in the following circumstances where they will be added to a supplemental signature list. The circumstances are: the voter presenting a valid voter identification card for that polling place and which does not indicate that the person has already voted; the voter's name appears on the national voter register but is not on the signature list at that polling place in the election district where he or she resides and has voted in at least one prior election and is not listed in any other polling place; the voter's name appears on the national voter register and on a signature list of a polling place in an election district where he or she does not reside and the voter did not apply for absentee voting. Any election board member, poll watcher or registered voter may challenge the identity or eligibility to vote of any person that appears at the polling place to vote on election day, by fileing an oral or written complaint. The board member is to give the challenged voter time to present witnesses and an explanation, if any, provided the decision is made prior to the close of polls. The decision may be appealed to the national election commissioner of the respective state, whose decision can be further appealed to the national election director. An election board member must record in the official log book for the polling place, the identifying informaton of any person who is not allowed to cast a ballot, and the reason for the disallowance. The person not allowed to vote shall then sign the log book next to the entry. The election legislation does not elaborate the procedures for the manner of voting, other than stating that all national elections shall be by secret ballot, which may be included in regulations issued by the national election board. The election law does provide that write-in votes may be used in national elections, whereby any name written upon a ballot shall be counted as a vote for that person. The law further provides that any voter who spoils a ballot may return it to a member of the election board and receive another one in its place, provided that the number of ballots given to him or her does not exceed three in all. Mobile voting also takes place on election day (or the day before the election day), whereby voters who are confined to their homes, hospitals or places of incarceration can submit a written request not more than 120 days before election day to vote at their place of confinement. If the voter is unable to personally complete or deliver the request form then the voter can request the assistance of a family  member. Mobile voters must vote in their place of confinement in secrecy, but any mobile voter who, by reason of physical disability, is unable to mark their ballot, is authorized to receive assistance to mark it.  Mobile voters and the election officials who assist these voters to vote may be required to submit an affidavit or other written statements to the national election director.",

Remember that you are qualified to vote if you are a registered voter and your name appears on the register of voters at your polling.  Opening of the Polling Units: On each Election Day, polling stations will open for Accreditation and Voting from 8:00 am to 2.00 pm. However, voters on the queue before the close of poll at 2:00pm will be accredited and allowed to vote.  Voting Procedure: Voting at the polling unit will be as follows:  Step 1:  At the polling unit, join the queue. An INEC official will check if you are at the correct polling unit and confirm that the PVC presented belongs to you.  Step 2:  An INEC official will confirm if your PVC is genuine using the card reader. You will be asked to place your finger on the card reader.  Step 3:  An INEC official will ask for your PVC and confirm you are listed in the Voters Register. Your name will be ticked and your finger will be inked to confirm you have voted. If your name is not found you cannot vote.  Step 4:  The Presiding officer will stamp, sign and endorse your ballot paper. You will be given the ballot paper rolled with the printed side inwards and directed to the voting cubicle.  Step 5:  Stain your finger with the ink given and mark the box for your preferred candidate/party. Roll the ballot paper in the manner you were given and flatten it.  Step 6:  Leave the voting cubicle and drop the ballot paper in the ballot box in full view of people at the Polling Unit.  Step 7:  Leave the Polling Unit or wait if you so choose, in an orderly and peaceful manner, to watch the process up to declaration of result.

Voters are required to vote at the electoral district in which they are registered in the voter lists. However, a voter can apply for an absentee voting certificate which allows them to vote in a polling station outside the electoral district in which they are registered, either on the terriroty of the Czech Republic or at a diplomatic mission abroad (the certificate must be handed in at the polling station where they choose to vote). At a polling station, the voter must prove his/her identity and citizenship of the Czech Republic with the necessary document. Each voter must vote in person; No proxy voting is allowed. The voter receives an empty official envelope, stamped with the official stamp of the district election commission. Upon request, the commission will also issue the voter a set of ballots.  With the official envelope and the ballots, the voter must go to the area designated for inserting the ballot into the official envelope. Otherwise, the voter will not be allowed to vote. The voter places one ballot for the candidate for whom she/he has decided to vote in the official envelope. The ballot cannot be modified in any way. The voter votes by inserting the official envelope with the selected ballot into the ballot box in front of the precinct election commission. Assisted voting is allowed for voters who are disabled or illiterate, but only another voter (not a poll worker) can assist.  Mobile voting is also available for home-bound voters upon request. Voting also takes place in medical and similar facilities, according to special voter lists.\n\nThe stamp on the official envelope is the stamp of a munucipal authority or an embassy. The commissions do not have its own stamp. The voter has to be in the designated area alone, except for the people with disabilites.",

Firstly, on the basis of registration in a special list of voters maintained by the embassy/consulate (in case of a long-term stay), with a registration deadline of no later than 40 days before the election day.  An absentee voting certificate can be issued for a voter who is registered at an embassy/consulate which allows them to vote at another embassy/consulate or polling station on the territory of the Czech Republic. Voters with a permanent residence in the Czech Republic but who register at an embassy will be removed from the permanent list of voters kept by the respective municipal office (when removed from the special voters list at an embassy/consullate, the voter will be put back on the permanent voter list in the Czech Republic.) Secondly, a voter with permanent residence in the Czech Republic can vote at any embassy abroad using a standard absentee voting certificate which they apply for ahead of the election. The Ministry of Interior sends the ballot papers electronically to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which forwards them to the diplomatic missions no later than 3 days before the election day. The diplomatic missions are to secure the printing or copying of the ballot papers. Voters who vote at diplomatic missions are to receive the ballots papers in the polling station. The method of voting at diplomatic missions is the same as for voting inside the territory of the Czech Republic. \n\n2012 Presidential Elections Act, Article 28(5), 31, 33",

The Prime Minister is appointed by the Amir, as is the Crown Prince, who also must be approved by the National Assembly. The Crown Prince is also designated as the Heir Apparent and the National Assembly must swear fealty to the Crown Prince.   Kuwait has a unicameral National Assembly (Majlis al-Umma), which has 50 members and 15 ex-officio seats reserved for cabinet ministers. Per the Constitution, there may be more ministers (and thus ex-officio members) so long as the number of ministers does not exceed one-third of the total assembly.   The highest courts in Kuwait are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. All judges are appointed by the Amir on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council. ",

Bulgaria has a unicameral National Assembly (Народно събрание / Narodno Sabranie) with 240 seats. Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

The outer envelope includes on its face the number of the elector's name on the roll.  Before sending out the postal voting paper, the Chief Electoral Officer must effectively conceal the consecutive number of the voting paper, write his or her initials and the elector's roll number on the counterfoil of the voting paper, place his or her official mark on both the counterfoil and the voting paper, and indicate on a copy of the roll beside the relevant electors' names, the fact that a postal voting paper has been forwarded to the elector, together with the date that it was forwarded.  Upon receipt of the postal voting paper, the elector shall alone and secretly, exercise his or her vote in accordance with the instructions on the voting paper and any additional instructions that the Chief Electoral Officer considers advisable to give to the elector. The elector then encloses the voting paper in the envelope marked \"Postal Vote\" and then encloses the envelope in the envelope addressed to the Chief Electoral Officer.  Provided the postal vote is received before the close of polls, the Chief Electoral Officer must record on the envelope received, the date of receipt and the name of the person from whom it was received if delivered by hand, draw a line in ink through the number of the elector on a copy of the roll to be called the \"Postal Votes Received\" and the date of receipt of that postal vote, open the envelope addressed to him or her and take out the envelope marked \"Postal Vote\" containing the voting paper and place the unopened envelope in the sealed or locked ballot box in his or her office designated for all postal votes. The ballot box shall not be opened until after the close of the poll.  Source: 2004 Electoral Act Articles 65 (1-5), 66 (1-2), 67 (1-2), 68, 69, 70 (1-2)",

Every applicant must sign and deliver to the Returning Officer a declaration in Form 12. The Returning Officer is to issue the applicant a voting paper and an envelope addressed to the Returning Officer and marked \"Vote in advance of poll\". Before giving the voting paper to the elector, the Returning Officer must follow the same procedures as for the issuing a voting paper on the ordinary polling day, e.g. concealing the consecutive number of the voting paper, writing his or her initials and the elector's roll number on the counterfoil, place his/her official mark on the counterfoil and voting paper, strike out the elector's name/number on the roll, etc.  The Returning Officer must also enter the date of the advance voting on the counterfoil and at the top right-hand corner of the voting paper, and also beside the name of the applicant on the roll. The applicant then proceeds alone to vote in secret, folds the voting paper, places it in the envelope provided, and delivers the envelope after sealing it to the Returning Officer. The Returning Officer must keep the safe custody of the sealed envelopes with the declarations attached and on polling day is to open all the advance voting envelopes and place the folded voting papers in the ballot box in the respective constituency.

        "instructions": "Electors who are ordinarily voting in-person on election day can vote at any place in their constituency that is designated for the taking of the poll. An elector informs the Presiding Officer of his or her name and the constituency in which he or she proposes to vote, and the Presiding Officer, being satisfied that the person is entitled to vote and has not already voted, issues the elector one voting paper.  If so required by any scrutineer, the Presiding Officer may, before issuing any voting paper, put certain questions to the person proposing to vote, for example, whether the person is at least 18 years of age or whether he or she has already voted in the election.  In issuing a voting paper, the Presiding Officer must firmly fix a piece of gummed paper over the consecutive number on the paper in order to conceal it or to otherwise conceal the number, write his or her initials and the elector's roll number on the counter foil of the voting paper, place his or her official mark on both the counterfoil and the voting paper, and draw a line in ink through the number and name of the elector on the roll as evidence that the elector has received a voting paper. The elector is to immediately go into one of the inner compartments of the polling booth/station and while there alone (except for the case of electors in need of assisted voting), secretly vote by marking a cross (or other clear mark) in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote.  If an elector inadvertently spoils a voting paper, he or she can return it to the Presiding Officer who will then supply the elector with a new voting paper. Before leaving the inner comparement, the elector is to fold the voting paper so that the contents cannot be seen and must then deposit it so folded in the ballot box (which is sealed or locked).   At the time of the close of the poll, electors who are present in a polling booth for the purpose of voting can cast their vote. Electors may not remain in the polling booth/station after casting a vote.  Any elector who has registered as an elector of a constitutency but whose name is not found on the roll for that constituency, or has since closing of the rolls become qualified as an elector in a constituency, or is on polling day present in a constituency other than that for which the person is registered as an elector (but has not cast an advance or postal vote) may, upon completing a declaration form, receive an ordinary voting paper and an envelope addressed to the Returning Officer marked \"Vote by Declaration\". Upon marking the voting paper in secret in an inner compartment, the elector shall place the paper, duly folded, into the envelope, and return the envelope to the Presiding Officer. After the preliminary count of the ordinary votes, the Presiding Officer is to forward the unopened envelopes with declarations to the Returning Officer who shall forward them to the Registrar of the relevant constitutency. The Registrar determines the elector's qualification or non-qualification and returns the envelopes to the Returning Officer who shall allow all qualified voting papers.

The prime minister is designated by the political party or alliance of political parties with a majority in the national legislature and is formally appointed by the president.  The Legislature is a unicameral Parliament, composed of the National Assembly. Parliamentarians are elected on national party slates with proportional representation. Ministers are also appointed by the president, following the recommendations of the prime minister.   The judiciary is notionally headed by the Supreme Court: as it has not yet been appointed, the Court of Appeal acts in its place.",

The president is directly elected by an absolute majority of the votes cast (if not, a second round is held) and if more than half of the registered voters have taken part in the voting (if not, a new election is held). Executive power is nominally exercised by the government, at its top sits a ceremonial prime minister, appointed directly by the President.  Legislative power is de jure vested in the bicameral parliament, the National Assembly. The 110 members of the lower House of Representatives are directly elected for five-year terms under a majoritarian system in single-member constituencies. The Council of the Republic is the upper chamber of territorial representation, its members elected at meetings of the local councils of deputies and the City of Minsk, plus eight members appointed by the President of the Republic.  The Constitutional Court is the highest court in Belarus which deals with matters involving the Constitution and legality of certain laws passed by the government. The Supreme Court is the highest court of general jurisdiction that deals with matters of civil and criminal law.",

At the time any person applies for a ballot paper, the presiding officer may, and if required by a candidate or his or her agent, must put to that person certain questions, such as relating to identity and whether the person has already voted in that election.   Immediately before giving a person a ballot paper, the presiding officer must mark the ballot with the offiical mark, call out the name, description and roll number of the elector, mark the elector's roll number on the counterfoil, and place a mark next to the elector's roll number in the register to indicate that a ballot paper has been received. Upon receiving a ballot, the elector must proceed into one of the compartments (polling booth) and, in secret, mark the ballot by placing a cross next to their chosen candidate. The voter then folds the ballot to conceal his or her vote and must then shows the presiding officer the back of the paper so as to disclose the official mark. In the presence of the presiding officer, the voter then puts the folded ballot into a sealed ballot box.   If a voters spoils their ballot, he or she can notify the presiding officer who will issue a new ballot paper upon return of the spoiled ballot.  Upon voting, the elector must immediately leave the polling station.

Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

Applications can be submitted in person, by fax, or electronically, to reach the Parliamentary Commission within 7 days of the issue of the writ of election. A person who meets the criteria and is enrolled as an overseas voter cannot vote in the the Bahamas on polling day. Overseas voting is held in-person at certain designated polling locations (High Commissions, Consulates, and other foreign missions of the Bahamas) on the appointed advance polling date. Persons who wish to vote in the Bahamas as a special voter on the advance polling day must apply in writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for a special voter certificate within 14 days of the issue of the writ of election.  The Parliamentary Commissioner designates the places for advance polling for special voters in the Bahamas, paying due regard to the facilities of such institutions as he or she may designate. Institutions that house certain categories of special voters, such as hospitals and nursing homes, can apply to be designated as an advance polling place for special voters.  Advance polling for eligible members of the police and defence forces is to be held at places designated by the Parliamentary Commission.  Not less than 14 days prior to the designated advance polling day, the police commissioner and defence force commodore must submit to the Parliamentary Commissioner a list of the members of the police and defence forces, respectively, which lists shall be made available for inspection by the Parliamentary Commissioner not later than 7 days before the advance polling day.  The election law provides that advance polling for all of the categories of advance voters is to be conducted in the same manner as the polling on the regular polling day in accordance with the law. At any advanced poll, a separate ballot box is provided, and at the close of such advanced poll the ballot papers in each box shall, without examination, be placed in separate packets and sealed by the presiding officer, each packet designating the number of ballot papers it contains and the relevant constituency. The sealed packets are to be immediately returned to the Parliamentary Commissioner (from both inside and outside the Bahamas) to be kept in his or her office or other safe place until delivery on the day appointed for the regular polling day to one of the presiding officers for the same constitutency to which such packet relates. Immediately before the commencement of the regular polling day, the presiding officer is to open such advance polling packets and without examining the ballot papers shall place them in the ballot box at his or her poll before he or she locks the box up and places the seal on it.",

The voter is to show his or her voter's card or other sufficient means of identification. Then, if the presiding officer is satisfied that the person has not already voted and that his or her name is on the voter register for that polling division, the voter is allowed to vote.  If a voter uses an identification other than a voter's card, the presiding officer must record the voter's name and type of ID on a list. If the presiding officer is not satified with the identification of the voter or his or her right to vote because of a defective voter's card, incorrect entry in the voter register, or missing entry on the voter register for the relevant constituency or polling division, the voter is allowed to cast a \"protest vote\" using a coloured ballot paper (regular ballot papers are white).  The presiding officer gives a voter one ballot paper after the officer signs his or her own name on the back of the ballot paper, calls out the number, full name and description of the peron as stated in the register and marks the said number on the counterfoil, puts a mark against the name of that person in the register to indicate that the person has voted in that polling division,  marks the thumb of the person by dipping the thumb of his or her right hand in indelible ink or by such other officially designated mark (or otherwise left thumb, other finger, or other way to indicate the person has been issued a ballot paper), and stamps that person's voter card to indicate that the person voted in that election in that polling division. After inspecting the person's thumb or fingers with the proper equipment, the presiding officer should refuse to give a ballot paper unless satisifed that there does not appear any such mark of indelible ink. If the proper equipment is not working properly or not available, each voter must take an oath that he or she has not previously voted in that election.  A refusal to give a voter a ballot paper must be recorded with a reason by the presiding officer. Before issuing a ballot paper, the presiding officer may, and, if required so to do by a candidate or election agent, must, require any person to to take and subscribe to an oath  to confirm his or her identify and residence qualification, and that he or she has not already voted in that election. If the voter refuses to do so, the ballot cannot be issued.  Before giving the voter the ballot paper, the presiding officer must immerse the voter's thumb (finger) in the indelible ink. Upon receiving a ballot paper, the voter is to immediately go into one of the compartments to secretly vote, using the indelible pencil provided, marking one cross opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she votes. The voter is to fold the ballot paper to conceal the vote, show the back of the paper to the presiding officer to show the officer's signature, and then drop the folded ballot paper into the ballot box. The voter must then immediately leave the polling station. A voter who inadvertently spoils a ballot paper can return it to the presiding officer and be issued a new one.

Such advance polling stations are considered by law to be, in effect, ordinary polling stations and for the conduct of advance voting the same rules apply as for voting on election day.  Advance (early) voting is to take place on three non-consecutive days during the 7-day period prior to election day. The first advance voting day is the Saturday before polling day for voters who reside or will be abroad or who will be in hospital on polling day, for voters in homes for the elderly, for election commissioners, and for residents of the main correctional facility. The second advance voting day is the Tuesday before polling day when voting takes place for the assistant election commissioners. The third advance voting day is the Thursday before polling day when voting takes place for voters inside hospitals. The hours for all advance voting are 7:00 am - 10:00 pm.

At the polling station, voters are required to present a voting document produced by the election commission which are distributed ahead of the election and that specifies the polling station where the voter must vote. Proxy voting is not allowed.  Once the election commisisioner is satisfied of the person's identity and that he or she is on the voter list, a ballot will be issued to the voter (after the commissioner puts the official mark on the ballot). The voter's name is to struck out on the list. Provided the voter's name is on the list, no inquiry is permitted at the time of voting as to the right of such person to vote. However, the commissioner can ask the person questions to confirm their identity and require the person to take an oath regarding their identity.  When the voter is issued a ballot, he or she  must proceed to the voting compartment to vote in secret. Each voter shall have one transferable vote. A voter, in recording his or her vote must place the figure 1 against the name of their chosen candidate and may in addition, indicate the order of his or her choice or preference for as many other candidates as he or she pleases by placing against their respective names the figure 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and so on in consecutive numerical order.  If a voter spoils the ballot paper, he or she can turn it into the assistant election commissioner and receive a new one. After marking the ballot paper, the voter shall fold the ballot so as to show the official mark while concealing his/her vote, show the official mark to the chairperson of the assistant commissioners, and shall then put the ballot in the sealed ballot box in the presence of the assistant commissioners.  Voters in need of assistance to mark their ballot (due to blindness, other physical cause or illiteracy) are required to read out loud their enumerated voting preferences in front of the assistant election commissioners, with one assistant commissioner marking their ballot accordingly. The polling station doors remain closed during this process, and no other voters are permitted inside. Braille templates are required to be made available for visually impaired voters.

However, a voter can apply with the local electoral commission up to three days before election day for absentee voting if they will not be at their district of registered permanent residence on election day, including voters who permanently reside abroad and are to be in Slovenia on election day. Absentee voting allows a voter to vote outside the regular polling station where he or she has permanent residence, at a designated polling station without territorial jurisdiction.  Hungarian and Italian national community voters residing outside of their bilingual municipalities have the opportunity to vote for their respective deputy in their place of residence anywhere in Slovenia and abroad.  At the polling station, voters give their name and surname (and if necessary their address) and the election committee official will determine the voter's identity using any personal identification document that shows the voter's personal data, or in some other manner. Proxy voting is not allowed. The electoral official then circles the serial number before the name on the voter register and the voter signs next to his or her name. The ballot paper(s) is then handed to the voter. Voters are entitled to one ballot, except members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities (which each have one deputy in the parliament) are entitled to a regular ballot and a ballot to vote for their respective ethnic miniority deputy, provided that the person is registered as a minority voter.  If requested by the voter, the election official must explain the technical aspects of the voting. If by mistake, a voter is not entered on the voter register, he or she may vote on the basis of a certificate issued by the competent body stating that he or she is enrolled as a voter in the area of that polling station. If the name of a person who wishes to vote has already been circled on the voter register and there is a signature next to the name, or if there is a note that the person is registered to vote by another method, this fact should be entered in the records, but the voter will not be allowed to vote.  Once issued the ballot(s), voters proceed to vote in secret in the polling booth as follows: (1) for the general ballot, the voter shall vote by circling the serial number before the name of the (one) candidate for whom he or she wishes to vote and (2) for the Hungarian and Italian national community ballot, the minority voter shall vote by circling the serial number before the name of the (one) candidate for whom he or she wishes to vote. The voter then proceeds to insert the ballot(s) in the ballot box.  Persons with disabilities can be assisted in voting by a person of their choice. Voters who are disabled or illiterate and not able to vote independently, can be assisted by a person of their choice to complete and cast the ballot paper(s).  Mobile voting is available for ill (and disabled?) voters who cannot vote in person at the polling station where they are registered to vote, whereby the election committee visits their home to facilitate their voting. Applications for mobile voting must be made no later than three days before polling day.  Source: 1992 National Assembly Elections Act Articles 7-9, 71-75, 79a",

        "instructions": "Voters generally vote at the polling stations at which they are registered to vote, that is in the place of their domocile. Absentee voting is allowed, whereby a voter can vote in a polling station in their area of temporary residence (including outside their election constituency, where they can vote for a candidate from their place of domocile), usually in a dedicated absentee polling station, based on an application submitted to the election authorites at least nine days prior to election day. Also, voters with disability can request to be transferred to an accessible polling station in their same settlement and constituency, if their regular polling station is not accessible. At a polling station, voters show an official identification card, which allows them to vote for a party list (or minority list) and show documentary proof of their address or their personal identification number, which allows them to vote for a constituency candidate.  Upon producing their identification documents and determination that the voter is on the voter list at that polling station and has not voted, the voter receives a ballot paper(s) (normally two ballots - a party/minority list ballot and a constituency ballot), to be stamped in front of the voter, and a ballot envelope, and the voter must sign the voter register (or if unable, two polling officials can sign). Voters registered as a minority voter can vote for a minority list (not a party list), and for constituency candidate. Absentee voters, even if voting outside their constituency, will be provided a ballot from the constituency of their domicile. When necessary, the polling official explains the voting process to the voter. The polling commission must advise voters to use the polling booth but cannot oblige them to do so. The voter then proceeds (to the polling booth) to mark their ballot(s).  Votes can only be cast by drawing two intersecting lines in the circle beside the name of the candidate, or above the name of the list, using a pen. The voter inserts the marked ballot(s) into the ballot envelope and inserts the envelope into the sealed ballot box. If the voter spoils the ballot paper, he or she can receive a new ballot from a polling official provided the spoiled ballot is returned before inserting it in the ballot box. Only one replacement per type of ballot can be provided. Voters with disability or who are illiterate can request a person of their choice (or two polling commission members) to assist them to fill in the ballot paper. Mobile voting can be requested by persons with limited mobility due to the health condition or disability or who are in detention, which is carried out by two members of the polling station commission. The same voting procedures apply for mobile voing; except instead of a polling booth, the voter must be provided circumstances to vote in secret. ",

Internally displaced persons have the right to either vote in the polling station of their temporary residence, provided such residence has been kept for at least six months, or in special \"absentee\" polling stations for the electoral unit where they were registered before being displaced.   The polling official determines the identity of the voter on the basis of one of three types of valid identification documents. Proxy voting is not allowed. Once the voter is identified, the polling official marks the voter's name in the voter register, the voter signs the voter register next to his or her name (must correspond to signature on ID), and a ballot is issued to the voter. Voters who are not found on the voter list on election day and  can present a valid identification card and proof of residence are allowed to vote.   To cast their vote, the voter proceeds to the polling booth to vote in secret. The voter marks their one preferred candidate on the ballot. If the voter spoils his or her ballot, a new ballot can be obtained upon returning the spoiled ballot to the polling station committee. Upon marking the ballot, the voter proceeds to insert it into the sealed ballot box.  A person registered as an out-of-country voter who has returned from abroad and wants to vote in-person in the country is entitled to vote by 'tendered' ballot. Tendered ballots are put by the voter into a sealed envelope bearing the voters identification information (which is then inserted into the ballox box) and later counted only after the envelope is forwarded to the central election body and the voter's information is checked against the central voter register.  A blind, illiterate or bodily incapacitated person can request from the president of the polling station committee to allow another person selected by the voter to assist him or her to sign the voter register and cast his or her ballot. The helper cannot be a polling official or election observer, and can help only one voter; the helper must sign the voter register next to the name of the voter he or she assisted.

      "details": "The governance structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was established by the 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian War. BiH is a parliamentary republic. It is comprised of three administrative divisons: Republika Srpska (primarily Serb), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (primarily Bosniak and Croat), and the Brcko District (primarily ethnically mixed). Each of the primary ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats) elect a president for a 4-year term. Each of these presidents serves on a rotating basis as the Chairman of the Presidency, with rotations every 8 months.   BiH has a bicameral national parliament (called the Assembly) that consists of the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives. The House of Peoples has 15 seats, with each of the three main ethnic groups alotted 5 seats each. Members of the House of Peoples are designated by regional parliaments in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska respectively. The House of Representatives is comprised of 42 total seats, which are split between members from Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.   Notably, both major entities in BiH have their own regional parliamentary systems. In Republika Srpska, there is a unicameral National Assembly with 83 seats. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a bicameral parliament with a total of approximately 180 seats split between the two houses. The Brcko District also has its own governance structure, but does not directly feed into the National Assembly in the same way.   The judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina is comprised of the Constitutional Court and the Court of BiH, as well as a variety of cantonal and municipal courts. Members of the Constitutional Court are selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights in consultation with the tripartite presidency. Note that Republika Srpska has begun the process of splitting away from the jurisdiction of the broader judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ",

The governor is appointed for a 6-year term by the monarch and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the legislature, or Staten, for 4-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve 4-year terms. Aruba's judicial system, mainly derived from the Dutch system, operates independently of the legislature and the executive. Jurisdiction, including appeal, lies with the Common Court of Justice of Aruba and the Supreme Court of Justice in the Netherlands.",

From Electoral Commission website: http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/postalvote  You need to download, print and fill in the postal vote application form.     Once you have completed the form and made sure you have signed it, you need to send it to the Electoral Registration Office for your area.    After the deadline to become a candidate has passed (approximately three weeks before polling day), ballot papers are produced and printed. Yours will then be sent to you, in your postal voting pack.     Complete the ballot paper in line with the instructions. Make sure you do it alone and in secret.   Once you've completed your ballot paper, put it in the smaller envelope and seal it up. Next, complete and sign the postal voting statement, and put everything inside the big envelope and seal it all up.  When you're ready to return your postal vote, take it to the postbox yourself.  If you can't post it yourself, you can either ask someone you know and trust to post it for you, or you can contact your local authority to ask if they can collect it from you.  Avoid asking a candidate or party worker to post it for you.  Your postal vote needs to be with your local authority by 10pm on polling day to be counted.  If you can't post your postal vote pack in time, you can take it your polling station or to your local authority on polling day.",

Permission for absentee voting (to allow a voter to vote at a polling station outside their area of residence) can be obtained by advance application by voters who will be away from their residential polling precinct on election day. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. Proxy voting is prohibited. Ballot papers are issued to voters included in the voter list upon presentation of a passport or document that replaces a citizens passport. Before issuing the ballot paper(s) to a voter, the precinct election commission is obliged to check that the voter has not already voted early (e.g. by portable ballot box in remote areas) or by mobile (homebound) voting. Each voter has a right to receive two ballot papers, one for voting in the federal electoral district and one for voting in the corresponding single-mandate electoral district (except absentee voters voting outside the territory of their single-mandate electoral district receive only the ballot for the federal electoral district.) A voter who is not on the voter list for any reason can be registered on election day, upon showing a passport or other proof of residence at the polling station. Upon receipt of the ballot, the identification document number of the voter is to be entered in the voter list. The voter checks the accuracy of the entry made and both the voter and the poll worker sign the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. The voter should enter the polling booth (or other specially equipped place for secret voting) to mark the ballot. Voters should vote alone, except a voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can request assistance of another person who is not a poll worker, partisan representative, or observer. The voter using assistance must notify the precinct election commission and the personal details of the helper are to be entered in the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. Using any mark, the voter marks the ballot for voting in the federal electoral district - in the square referring to the chosen list of candidates, and on the ballot for voting in the single mandate electoral district - in the square referring to the chosen candidate.  A voter who spoils a ballot can receive a replacement one from the poll worker, who records the issuance of a replacement ballot in the voter list next to the voter's name and signs the entry along with the secretary of the precinct election commission. The voters puts the marked ballots into the sealed ballot box. If the Central Election Commission makes a decision to use ballot envelopes, the voter is to place the marked ballots into the envelope given to him/her by the poll worker after leaving the polling booth, and places the envelope in the ballot box. Electronic voting and counting machines may be used at polling stations.   Mobile (homebound) voting is available, upon advance application, for voters who, due to health reasons, disability, caring for a person in need, or other reasons, cannot go to the polling station.

The President of Russia is the head of state and there is a multi-party system with executive power exercised by the government, headed by the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the President with parliament's approval. The government consists of the Prime Minister, deputy prime ministers, and federal ministers and their ministries and departments. The Prime Minister submits to the President nominations for all subordinate Government positions, including deputy prime ministers, and federal ministers.  The President is directly elected under a two-round system in a single nationwide constituency for a six-year period.  Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Federal Assembly. The 450 members of the lower house - State Duma - are elected  for a term of five years, with parallel voting. Half of the seats (225) are elected by closed party-list proportional representation within a single nationwide constituency, with a five per cent electoral threshold, with the other half elected in 225 single-member constitutencies by first-past-the-post voting.  Regional assemblies with their respective deputies are formed through this system. The upper chamber - Federation Council - is not directly elected; each of the 85 federal subjects of Russia (oblasts, republics, autonomous territories, and autonomous okrugs) sends two delegates to the Federal Council, for a total of 170 members.  The judiciary of Russia is topped by the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Supreme Court of Arbitration.  The judiciary is governed by the All-Russian Congress of Judges and its Council of Judges.",

A voter casts a ballot in the polling station in the  constituency where he/she is on the voter register (or at any polling station in the constituency where the polling card was issued). Proxy voting is not permitted. Measures must be taken to ensure that the voter can cast the vote and fold the ballot paper without being observed, either a voting booth or room adjoining the main room.  Upon entering the polling station, the voter is given an official ballot paper and may be requested to show his/her voter notice.  In the voting booth, the voter casts the two votes by twice marking the ballot with a cross or other sign to clearly indicate the candidate and party list of choice. The two votes are cast on one ballot that has two parts - one part for the constituency candidate and one part for the party list. The voter then folds the ballot paper to ensure the secrecy of the vote, and approaches the table of the electoral board and hands over his/her voter's notice and identification document ( identification document is not strictly required, unless the voter does not have a voter's notice or if the poll worker otherwise requests). If the voter's notice or identification document is not presented the voter is not allowed to cast the ballot. The poll worker checks the voter's information against the voter register and if present and not marked as voted, marks in the voter register that the voter has voted and allows the voter to proceed to put the ballot in the locked ballot box. If the voter is not in the voter register (or does not produce a polling card if present in the polling register as having received a postal voting package), he/she is not allowed to vote. Other grounds for refusing the voter to cast the ballot is if the voter marked or folded the ballot outside the booth or otherwise jeoparidized the secrecy of the vote. If a voters spoils her/his ballot, another ballot can be requested provided that the voter  destroys the spoiiled ballot in the presence of a poll worker. Voting machines can be used instead of ballot papers and ballot boxes to facilitate the casting and counting of votes.  A voter who is illiterate or has a disability can request a person to assist provided the person does not have a conflict of interest. The person assisting is bound to mark the ballot according to the intent of the voter and must keep the ballot choice secret.   Only voters who arrive before the end of polling hours and are inside the polling station or in front of it due to lack of space shall be permitted to cast their votes.",

Toutefois, la CENI peut, pour faciliter aux électeurs l’exercice de leur droit de vote, avancer l’heure d’ouverture ou retarder l’heure de la clôture dans certaines circonscriptions électorales.   Dans tous les cas, les opérations du vote doivent se dérouler dans un intervalle de temps de onze (11) heures précises.   Les électeurs présents devant le bureau de vote doivent voter. A cet effet, à l’heure officielle de clôture, le Président du bureau de vote fait ramasser les cartes des électeurs en commençant par le dernier de la file en attente, et seuls ceux-ci sont autorisés à voter, mention en est faite au procès-verbal.   Un arrêté du Président de la CENI précise les modalités d’application de ces dispositions.   Art. 64 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : Nul ne peut être admis à voter s’il ne justifie de son identité.   La carte d’électeur biométrique est l’unique document de vérification de l’identité de l’électeur.   Le vote par témoignage est interdit.   Art. 65 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : Les électeurs inscrits sur la liste d’une même circonscription électorale, lorsqu’ils changent de résidence à l’intérieur de cette dernière, sont autorisés à voter dans le bureau de vote de leur nouvelle résidence, sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.         Leurs noms sont ajoutés sur la liste des électeurs votants.   Dans le cas d’espèce, l’électeur doit justifier par un récépissé de changement de résidence délivré et authentifié par la CENI locale ou la Commission administrative de son ressort.   Art. 66 : Pour les élections législatives, les candidats déclarés éligibles par la Cour constitutionnelle sont autorisés à voter dans l’un des bureaux de vote du ressort de la circonscription électorale dans laquelle ils se portent candidats sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.   Art. 67 : Les membres du bureau de vote régulièrement inscrits sur une liste électorale peuvent voter dans le bureau de vote où ils ont été nommés quelle que soit l’élection.   Les délégués détenteurs d’un mandat votent dans le bureau où ils ont été désignés pour leur mission.   Les personnes chargées d’assurer la sécurité des bureaux de votes sont autorisées à voter dans lesdits bureaux sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.   Les agents des forces de défense et de sécurité, les membres et le personnel de la CENI et de ses démembrements, les membres et les délégués de la Cour constitutionnelle, les observateurs nationaux et les délégués des partis politiques sont autorisés à voter dans l’un des bureaux de vote de la circonscription électorale dans laquelle ils sont en mission, sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique, de leur mandat ou de leur Ordre de mission.      Le président du bureau de vote est tenu de leur faciliter le vote.   Dans tous les cas, mention du vote doit être faite au procès-verbal avec l’ensemble des caractéristiques de la carte d’électeur.   Art. 68 : Le vote est personnel et secret.   Le choix de l’électeur est libre.   Nul ne doit être influencé dans son choix par la contrainte, la menace ou la violence.   Le vote a lieu dans les bureaux désignés par la CENI.   Art. 69 : Le vote se fait au moyen d’un bulletin unique, à mettre dans l’urne par l’électeur.   Tout électeur atteint d’infirmité ou de handicap physique le mettant dans l’impossibilité d’introduire son bulletin dans l’urne est autorisé à se faire assister par un électeur de son choix ou par un membre du bureau de vote.      Art. 75 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : A son entrée dans le bureau de vote, l’électeur porteur de sa carte d’électeur biométrique ou de la preuve de son droit de voter par la production d’une décision du Président du Tribunal d’Instance, après avoir fait constater qu’aucune de ses mains ne porte d’empreinte et de trace d’encre indélébile, prend lui- même un bulletin unique mis à sa disposition. Le président ou un membre du bureau de vote lit à haute et intelligible voix les noms et prénoms de l’électeur qui s’apprête à voter. Celui-ci, sans quitter le bureau de vote exprime son choix. Cette opération doit se faire dans l’isoloir.   Il fait ensuite constater au président qu’il n’est porteur que d’un seul bulletin unique qu’il introduit lui-même dans l’urne.   Art. 76 : Le vote par procuration est exceptionnel ; il n’est admis qu’en cas d’incapacité physique ou d’empêchement majeur.   Sont déclarées valables les seules procurations établies par les présidents des commissions électorales locales conformément au modèle défini par la CENI.   Tout électeur mandaté pour voter par procuration doit être muni de la carte d’électeur et de la pièce d’identification de la personne qui l’a mandaté.         Le mandataire doit être inscrit dans le même bureau de vote que le mandant. Il ne peut être détenteur que d’une seule procuration.   La procuration doit être établie en deux (2) exemplaires dont l’un sera remis au mandant et l’autre classé dans les archives de la Commission locale des élections.   Elle doit être numérotée et enregistrée dans un registre spécial.   Toute procuration ne respectant pas les prescriptions du présent article est nulle.   A l’issue du dépouillement, les procurations sont jointes aux bulletins nuls, tels que prévus à l’article 88 ci-dessous et transmis à la juridiction compétente.   Art. 77 : Le vote de chaque électeur est constaté par son identification tel que prévue par l’article 75 ci-dessus, puis par sa signature ou son empreinte digitale apposée sur la liste d’émargement en face de son nom.   De plus, le vote de l’électeur est constaté par l’imprégnation de son pouce gauche à l’encre indélébile.   Tout électeur détenteur d’une procuration dûment mandatée doit procéder aux deux (2) opérations avant de passer son pouce à l’encre indélébile.       L’électeur atteint d’une infirmité le privant de son index ou de son pouce peut apposer l’empreinte de tout autre doigt sur la liste d’émargement. S’il ne dispose d’aucun doigt, la personne qui l’assiste est autorisée par le président de bureau de vote à apposer l’empreinte de son index.      Art. 78 : Dès la clôture du scrutin, la liste d’émargement est signée par tous les membres du bureau de vote.   Cette liste d’émargement est tenue à la disposition de tout électeur qui désire la consulter à la Circonscription électorale, pendant un délai de huit (8) jours à partir de la proclamation des résultats provisoires.",

Toutefois, la CENI peut, pour faciliter aux électeurs l’exercice de leur droit de vote, avancer l’heure d’ouverture ou retarder l’heure de la clôture dans certaines circonscriptions électorales.   Dans tous les cas, les opérations du vote doivent se dérouler dans un intervalle de temps de onze (11) heures précises.   Les électeurs présents devant le bureau de vote doivent voter. A cet effet, à l’heure officielle de clôture, le Président du bureau de vote fait ramasser les cartes des électeurs en commençant par le dernier de la file en attente, et seuls ceux-ci sont autorisés à voter, mention en est faite au procès-verbal.   Un arrêté du Président de la CENI précise les modalités d’application de ces dispositions.   Art. 64 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : Nul ne peut être admis à voter s’il ne justifie de son identité.   La carte d’électeur biométrique est l’unique document de vérification de l’identité de l’électeur.   Le vote par témoignage est interdit.   Art. 65 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : Les électeurs inscrits sur la liste d’une même circonscription électorale, lorsqu’ils changent de résidence à l’intérieur de cette dernière, sont autorisés à voter dans le bureau de vote de leur nouvelle résidence, sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.         Leurs noms sont ajoutés sur la liste des électeurs votants.   Dans le cas d’espèce, l’électeur doit justifier par un récépissé de changement de résidence délivré et authentifié par la CENI locale ou la Commission administrative de son ressort.   Art. 66 : Pour les élections législatives, les candidats déclarés éligibles par la Cour constitutionnelle sont autorisés à voter dans l’un des bureaux de vote du ressort de la circonscription électorale dans laquelle ils se portent candidats sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.   Art. 67 : Les membres du bureau de vote régulièrement inscrits sur une liste électorale peuvent voter dans le bureau de vote où ils ont été nommés quelle que soit l’élection.   Les délégués détenteurs d’un mandat votent dans le bureau où ils ont été désignés pour leur mission.   Les personnes chargées d’assurer la sécurité des bureaux de votes sont autorisées à voter dans lesdits bureaux sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.   Les agents des forces de défense et de sécurité, les membres et le personnel de la CENI et de ses démembrements, les membres et les délégués de la Cour constitutionnelle, les observateurs nationaux et les délégués des partis politiques sont autorisés à voter dans l’un des bureaux de vote de la circonscription électorale dans laquelle ils sont en mission, sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique, de leur mandat ou de leur Ordre de mission.         Le président du bureau de vote est tenu de leur faciliter le vote.   Dans tous les cas, mention du vote doit être faite au procès-verbal avec l’ensemble des caractéristiques de la carte d’électeur.   Art. 68 : Le vote est personnel et secret.   Le choix de l’électeur est libre.   Nul ne doit être influencé dans son choix par la contrainte, la menace ou la violence.   Le vote a lieu dans les bureaux désignés par la CENI.   Art. 69 : Le vote se fait au moyen d’un bulletin unique, à mettre dans l’urne par l’électeur.   Tout électeur atteint d’infirmité ou de handicap physique le mettant dans l’impossibilité d’introduire son bulletin dans l’urne est autorisé à se faire assister par un électeur de son choix ou par un membre du bureau de vote.      Art. 75 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : A son entrée dans le bureau de vote, l’électeur porteur de sa carte d’électeur biométrique ou de la preuve de son droit de voter par la production d’une décision du Président du Tribunal d’Instance, après avoir fait constater qu’aucune de ses mains ne porte d’empreinte et de trace d’encre indélébile, prend lui- même un bulletin unique mis à sa disposition. Le président ou un membre du bureau de vote lit à haute et intelligible voix les noms et prénoms de l’électeur qui s’apprête à voter. Celui-ci, sans quitter le bureau de vote exprime son choix. Cette opération doit se faire dans l’isoloir.   Il fait ensuite constater au président qu’il n’est porteur que d’un seul bulletin unique qu’il introduit lui-même dans l’urne.   Art. 76 : Le vote par procuration est exceptionnel ; il n’est admis qu’en cas d’incapacité physique ou d’empêchement majeur.   Sont déclarées valables les seules procurations établies par les présidents des commissions électorales locales conformément au modèle défini par la CENI.   Tout électeur mandaté pour voter par procuration doit être muni de la carte d’électeur et de la pièce d’identification de la personne qui l’a mandaté.         Le mandataire doit être inscrit dans le même bureau de vote que le mandant. Il ne peut être détenteur que d’une seule procuration.   La procuration doit être établie en deux (2) exemplaires dont l’un sera remis au mandant et l’autre classé dans les archives de la Commission locale des élections.   Elle doit être numérotée et enregistrée dans un registre spécial.   Toute procuration ne respectant pas les prescriptions du présent article est nulle.   A l’issue du dépouillement, les procurations sont jointes aux bulletins nuls, tels que prévus à l’article 88 ci-dessous et transmis à la juridiction compétente.   Art. 77 : Le vote de chaque électeur est constaté par son identification tel que prévue par l’article 75 ci-dessus, puis par sa signature ou son empreinte digitale apposée sur la liste d’émargement en face de son nom.   De plus, le vote de l’électeur est constaté par l’imprégnation de son pouce gauche à l’encre indélébile.   Tout électeur détenteur d’une procuration dûment mandatée doit procéder aux deux (2) opérations avant de passer son pouce à l’encre indélébile.       L’électeur atteint d’une infirmité le privant de son index ou de son pouce peut apposer l’empreinte de tout autre doigt sur la liste d’émargement. S’il ne dispose d’aucun doigt, la personne qui l’assiste est autorisée par le président de bureau de vote à apposer l’empreinte de son index.         Art. 78 : Dès la clôture du scrutin, la liste d’émargement est signée par tous les membres du bureau de vote.   Cette liste d’émargement est tenue à la disposition de tout électeur qui désire la consulter à la Circonscription électorale, pendant un délai de huit (8) jours à partir de la proclamation des résultats provisoires.   A l’issue du scrutin, les listes d’émargement sont conservées au chef-lieu de la commune sous la responsabilité du Maire, de l’Ambassadeur ou du Consul dans les représentations diplomatiques ou consulaires du Niger à l’étranger.",

Art. 75 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : A son entrée dans le bureau de vote, l’électeur porteur de sa carte d’électeur biométrique ou de la preuve de son droit de voter par la production d’une décision du Président du Tribunal d’Instance, après avoir fait constater qu’aucune de ses mains ne porte d’empreinte et de trace d’encre indélébile, prend lui- même un bulletin unique mis à sa disposition. Le président ou un membre du bureau de vote lit à haute et intelligible voix les noms et prénoms de l’électeur qui s’apprête à voter. Celui-ci, sans quitter le bureau de vote exprime son choix. Cette opération doit se faire dans l’isoloir.   Il fait ensuite constater au président qu’il n’est porteur que d’un seul bulletin unique qu’il introduit lui-même dans l’urne.   Art. 76 : Le vote par procuration est exceptionnel ; il n’est admis qu’en cas d’incapacité physique ou d’empêchement majeur.   Sont déclarées valables les seules procurations établies par les présidents des commissions électorales locales conformément au modèle défini par la CENI.   Tout électeur mandaté pour voter par procuration doit être muni de la carte d’électeur et de la pièce d’identification de la personne qui l’a mandaté.         Le mandataire doit être inscrit dans le même bureau de vote que le mandant. Il ne peut être détenteur que d’une seule procuration.   La procuration doit être établie en deux (2) exemplaires dont l’un sera remis au mandant et l’autre classé dans les archives de la Commission locale des élections.   Elle doit être numérotée et enregistrée dans un registre spécial.   Toute procuration ne respectant pas les prescriptions du présent article est nulle.   A l’issue du dépouillement, les procurations sont jointes aux bulletins nuls, tels que prévus à l’article 88 ci-dessous et transmis à la juridiction compétente.   Art. 77 : Le vote de chaque électeur est constaté par son identification tel que prévue par l’article 75 ci-dessus, puis par sa signature ou son empreinte digitale apposée sur la liste d’émargement en face de son nom.   De plus, le vote de l’électeur est constaté par l’imprégnation de son pouce gauche à l’encre indélébile.   Tout électeur détenteur d’une procuration dûment mandatée doit procéder aux deux (2) opérations avant de passer son pouce à l’encre indélébile.       L’électeur atteint d’une infirmité le privant de son index ou de son pouce peut apposer l’empreinte de tout autre doigt sur la liste d’émargement. S’il ne dispose d’aucun doigt, la personne qui l’assiste est autorisée par le président de bureau de vote à apposer l’empreinte de son index.         Art. 78 : Dès la clôture du scrutin, la liste d’émargement est signée par tous les membres du bureau de vote.   Cette liste d’émargement est tenue à la disposition de tout électeur qui désire la consulter à la Circonscription électorale, pendant un délai de huit (8) jours à partir de la proclamation des résultats provisoires.   A l’issue du scrutin, les listes d’émargement sont conservées au chef-lieu de la commune sous la responsabilité du Maire, de l’Ambassadeur ou du Consul dans les représentations diplomatiques ou consulaires du Niger à l’étranger.",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

Poland has a bicameral Parliament composed of a 100-seat Senate and a 460-seat Sejm. Senators are directly elected by plurality vote in single-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Members of the Sejm are directly elected by party-list proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties must earn at least 5% of the national vote to gain a seat in the Sejm, and coalitions must earn 8% of the vote with minority parties excepted from this standard.  Poland has two high courts: the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is composed of 121 judges separated into thematic chambers. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the National Judicial Council and confirmed by the President, and they may serve until age 65. The Constitutional Tribunal is composed of 15 judges appointed by the Sejm to serve a 9-year term.",

Il comptait 6.298.801 électeurs dont 3.284.569 (52,15%) femmes et 3.014.232 (47,85%) hommes. La mise à jour du fichier, effectuée du 1er au 30 octobre 2020, a produit 1.283.405 nouveaux enregistrements en données centralisées brutes. Une recherche biométrique de doublons via le système ABIS a identifié environs 20% de ces nouveaux enregistrements comme étant potentiellement doubles ou multiples. Ceci se doit  principalement au fait que les électeurs pouvaient demander à s'inscrire sans que les agents puissent identifier ceux qui étaient déjà dans la base de données de 2015. La déduplication manuelle, comportant l’analyse des cas possibles de doublon et l’adjudication par la CENI, a permis de supprimer 193.858 doublons. Sous réserve de publication de statistiques officielles, les nouveaux enregistrements représentent finalement 1.089.547, soit 54,47% de la cible de 2.000.000 d’électeurs.

Unlike the 2018 Constitution, the latter benefits from a better image, being the fruit of numerous consultations that led to a consensus during the Sovereign National Conference organised in 1993.  The text of this new fundamental law - the eleventh since the country's independence in 1960 - marks a return to a semi-presidential system, replacing the presidential system of 2018 by confirming the restoration of the post of Prime Minister as head of government accountable to the National Assembly, distinct from the role of Head of State of the President of the Republic. The President's term of office will be reduced from six to five years, always renewable once consecutively. The minimum age for presidential candidates is lowered from 40 to 35. The draft constitution also ratifies the existence of the Senate, which was theoretically created by the 2018 constitution but has never yet been set up, as well as the division of the country into 23 regions, or provinces.  The text is also notable for its objective of restoring a number of rights, concepts and democratic institutions that had been removed from the 1996 text by a succession of constitutional revisions under the presidency of Idriss Déby. Independence of the judiciary has been consolidated by assigning the chairmanship of the High Council of the Judiciary not to the President of the Republic but to the President of the Supreme Court, who was previously second vice-president. The High Court of Justice, placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2018, has also regained its independence as an institution, and the sole power to try for high treason the President of the Republic, those of other institutions, as well as members of the government and their possible accomplices.The same applies to the Constitutional Council, which regains its independence from the Supreme Court and exercises sole control over the constitutionality of laws, organic laws, decrees and international treaties.Its review is carried out automatically before they are promulgated, but also a posteriori on the basis of a dispute referred to the Council by an ordinary court.The Council also judges electoral disputes and administers the oath of office to the newly elected President of the Republic.  In terms of military justice, a Court of Appeal was created, in addition to the military courts and the Supreme Court.",

Overseas voting will takeplace in person at polling stations which will be set up in embassies, consulates and suitable venues of Greek disaspora organizations. For an out-of-country polling station to be constituted, a minimum of 40 registered voters is required. On the day appointed for voting, voters come to the polling station of the relevant electoral division and present themselves to the electoral commitee, which determines their identity based on their Greeck police ID or Greek passport, and verifies their registration in the foreign voter list. To each voter, the electoral committee delivers an envelope initialed by the representative of the judicial authority and sealed with a stamp of the committee, a complete set of ballot forms and a blank ballot. Then the voter proceeds to the special separate area, in such a way that he/she cannot be seen, and there the voter secretly inserts the ballot paper of his choosing in the envelope given to him/her by the election committee. After securely sealing the envelope, the voter returns to the election committee and shows the envelope to the members and other attendees, to show that he/she is holding only one envelope, and then inserts the envelope into the ballot box. The election committee draws up minutes during the voting for every matter related to its conduct.\n\nThe 2023 elections will be the first time that certain out-of-country Greek citizens will be able to vote abroad.  According to legislation adopted in December 2019, after the 2019 parliamentary elections,  registered voters who are temporarily or permanently abroad must fulfil two main requirements in order to vote abroad. They must have had a two-year stay in Greece in the last 35 years and for those over 30 years old they  must have filed  a tax return in Greece in the year of the election or the preceding year.",

The voter has the right to indicate a preference regarding the order of the candidates on the list. Vote must be without assistance or without anyone seeing his vote; thereafter, he/she writes the address on the covering letter and signs it in the presence of the election official, who witnesses the casting of the vote.

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

The executive branch is led by the President, who is the head of state, commander-in-chief, and head of government. The President appoints a cabinet of ministers from elected members of parliament and can serve up to two five-year terms. The Prime Minister, as the President's deputy, leads the ruling party in parliament and shares domestic responsibilities. The legislative branch is a unicameral 225-member parliament, with 196 members elected from multi-seat constituencies and 29 through proportional representation. All members serve five-year terms through universal suffrage. The parliament holds the power to make laws, while the President can summon, suspend, or dissolve sessions. The judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court as the highest court, a Court of Appeal, High Courts, and subordinate courts. The legal system blends British criminal law, Roman civil law, and customary laws. Judges are appointed by the President, with a judicial service commission managing lower court judges.",

The President is directly elected by absolute majority vote in up to two rounds and may serve two 5-year terms. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Sejm.  Poland has a bicameral Parliament composed of a 100-seat Senate and a 460-seat Sejm. Senators are directly elected by plurality vote in single-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Members of the Sejm are directly elected by party-list proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties must earn at least 5% of the national vote to gain a seat in the Sejm, and coalitions must earn 8% of the vote with minority parties excepted from this standard.  Poland has two high courts: the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is composed of 121 judges separated into thematic chambers. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the National Judicial Council and confirmed by the President, and they may serve until age 65. The Constitutional Tribunal is composed of 15 judges appointed by the Sejm to serve a 9-year term.",

The President is elected indirectly through the Electoral College, a body made up of electors with each state receiving the number of electors equal to the size of their delegation in both house  of Congress. Generally, the electors give their votes to the candidate who won the state. The President is elected to four-year terms with an absolute two-term limit.  The legislature is a bicameral Congress consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the Senate, 100 members are elected by plurality vote (2 members per state) to serve 6-year terms. One-third of Senate seats are up for election every 2 years. In the House of Representatives, 435 members are elected by plurality vote in single-member constituencies to serve 2-year terms.  The Supreme Court is the highest court in the US judiciary. The court consists of nine justices, each nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Justices serve lifetime appointments. The federal court system also includes 13 regional courts of appeal and 94 district courts.",

The king remains the country’s ultimate authority and wields power over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The king appoints the prime minister who then chooses a cabinet.  Both the prime minister and cabinet appointments must be approved by the parliament.  Jordan has a bicameral National Assembly (Majlis al-Ummah), with a Senate (Majlis al-Aʿyan) as its upper chamber, and a House of Representatives (Majlis al-Nuwwāb) as its lower chamber. Members of the Senate are appointed by the king for four-year terms, while members of the House of Representatives are elected every four years. A small number of seats in the House of Representatives are reserved for Christians and Circassians.  Judges are appointed and dismissed by royal decree following a decision made by the Justices Council. There are three categories of courts. The regular courts, including those of magistrates, courts of first instance, and courts of appeals and cassation in Amman, hear appeals passed on from lower courts. The constitution also provides for a Special Council, which interprets the laws and determines their constitutionality. There are also religious courts and special courts which deal with particular matters such as land, taxes, and customs.",

Ballot papers are issued to voters on the voter register who submit an identification document. Voters sign the voter register to confirm receipt of the ballot, and the ballot issuer also signs the voter register against the name of the voter who is given the ballot.  Voters must mark the ballot(with the chosen political party) using a pen in a polling booth.  Voters who cannot independently fill in a ballot can be assisted by a person whom he/she trusts (but not a poll worker, public official, candidate proxy, journalist, or election observer). Mobile voting can be requested in writing, not later than 12:00 am on election day, by voters who cannot come to the polling station due to state of health or having to care for an ill family member, as well as voters living in remote areas where no polling station exists.  The secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. Ballots shall be filled in by voters in a polling booth. While filling in the ballots, the presence of anybody in the polling booth, except the voter, shall be forbidden. Note that Kazakhstan has two time zones: Kazakhstan Eastern Standard Time, which is 6 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT6).  Kazakhstan Western Standard Time (merged with Kazakhstan CentralStandard Time) is 5 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT+5).",

The Polling Clerk checks that there is no stamp for this election on your Electoral Card. 3. The Polling Clerk looks for your name on the Electoral Roll and checks your name on both new (VES list) and old electoral roll (GVRS list). 4. When the Polling Clerk has found your name and has checked your identity, he or she will place a tick next to your name and number – make sure you are included successfully in the new Electoral Roll based on National ID registration, as this roll will be the only one to be used in future elections! 5. The Polling Clerk will give you an envelope and a booklet containing a ballot paper for each candidate. 6. Go to the Voting booth. – People with disabilities who cannot get to the polling booth or cast their ballot on their own can appoint a person to help them. This person must be a registered voter. 7. Look through the candidate booklet carefully and find the ballot paper of the person you want to vote for. You can find it easily by looking for their photo or their symbol. 8. Put the ballot paper of the candidate you want to vote for into the envelope and come out of the Voting booth. 9. Show the Polling Clerk that you have one envelope only. Throw away the left-over ballot papers in the closed bin outside the voting booths, or where the Polling Clerk tells you. 10. Put your envelope into the ballot box. 11. The polling Clerk stamps your Electoral Card with the official government stamp in the place that says “Date of Voting”. They add the date and sign. 12. Give the Polling Clerk your left thumb and get it inked. 13. Take your Electoral Card back. 14. Leave the Polling station",

The president is elected by direct popular vote, under a two-round system, for a five-year term.\n\nThe members of the 150-seat parliament (National Council) are elected for a four-year term under a proportional representation system, within a single nationwide constituency, with a 5% threshold for parties, 7% for coalitions of two or three parties, and 10% for coalitions of more than four parties. Following National Council elections, the leader of the majority party or coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the country's highest appellate court, the judges of which are elected by the National Council; below that are regional, district, and military courts. The Constitutional Court rules on constitutional issues; its 13 members are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by the parliament. The 18-member Judicial Council nominates common court judges and is responsible for appointing a disciplinary committee in cases of judicial misconduct.",

      "details": "Iran has a unique system of government known as an Islamic Republic, a combination of democratic and theocratic elements, as outlined in its Constitution established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The political structure is characterized by a dual sovereignty: the Supreme Leader, who holds the highest state authority, and the elected President, along with the Parliament. It blends aspects of a parliamentary democracy with Islamic theocracy, guided by the principles of Shia Islam.  The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected for a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country, including the implementation of laws, overseeing the economy, and conducting foreign policy. However, the President's powers are subject to the oversight and approval of the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in Iran. The Supreme Leader, appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant influence over all branches of government, including the military and judiciary, and has the final say in matters of state and religion.  The legislative branch consists of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, a unicameral body whose members are elected by the public. The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. However, all Majlis decisions can be vetted and must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body consisting of twelve members, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The judicial branch, independent in theory, operates under the influence of the Supreme Leader. It is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and Sharia law, ensuring that all legislation and executive actions conform to Islamic principles. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and oversees the court system, which includes public courts, revolutionary courts, and special clerical courts.",

[Amended by Act 11/1971] (2) The presiding officer shall instruct the voter how to make his or her mark, and shall properly fold the voter’s ballot paper, directing him or her to return it, when marked, folded as shown, but without inquiring or seeing for whom the voter intends to vote, except when the voter is unable to vote in the manner prescribed by this Act on account of illiteracy, blindness or other physical incapacity. (3) The voter, on receiving the ballot paper, shall forthwith enter one of the polling compartments in the polling station and there mark his ballot paper by marking with a black lead pencil and not otherwise a cross within the space opposite the name and symbol of the candidate for whom he or she intends to vote, and he or she shall then fold the ballot paper as directed so that the initials and the numbers on the counterfoil can be seen without opening it, and hand the paper to the presiding officer who shall, without unfolding it, ascertain by examination of the initials and the number appearing thereon that it is the same paper as that delivered to the voter and, if the same, he or she shall, subject to section 83, in full view of the voter and of all others present remove the counterfoil and deposit the ballot in the ballot box. [Amended by Act 11/1971] (4) A voter who has inadvertently so dealt with the ballot paper delivered to him or her that it cannot conveniently be used shall restore it to the presiding officer who shall cancel it by writing the word “Spoiled” across the face of the same, and the presiding officer shall then deliver another ballot paper to the voter. (5) Every voter shall vote without undue delay and shall leave the polling station as soon as his or her ballot paper has been put into the ballot box. (6) If at the closing of the poll there are any voters inside the polling station who are qualified to vote and have not been able to do so since their arrival at the polling station, the poll shall be kept open a sufficient time to enable them to vote, but no one not actually present within the polling station at the hour of closing shall be allowed to vote.

(1) The presiding officer at the time any person applies for a ballot paper, but not afterwards, (a) shall request that person to produce his or her national identification card; and (b) may, and if requested by a candidate or his or her agent, put to the voter the following questions: (i) are you the same person whose name appears as “A.B.” in the register of voters now in force for this polling division?; (ii) have you already voted at this election either here or elsewhere. (2) Subject to subsection (3), a ballot paper shall not be issued to any person who (a) does not produce his or her national identification card when required to do so under subsection (1)(a); and (b) does not satisfactorily answer the questions asked of him or her under subsection (1)(b). (3) A ballot paper shall be issued to any person whose name appears in the register of voters and who is unable to produce his or her national identification card, if he or she satisfies the presiding officer that (a) a national identification card has not been delivered to him or her; (b) the national identification card delivered to him or her is lost or destroyed; or (c) he or she has been duly registered to vote and his or her particulars appear on Form 3A; and that he or she is the same person whose name appears in the register of voters by producing a valid passport or other Government issued photo identification card.",

Slightly more than half the members are directly elected, with the remainder selected by the islands’ local governments.   Changes brought about by the 2001 constitution granted the three main islands partial autonomy, and each elects its own governor and legislative assembly. The government of each island is free to administer its own affairs so long as its actions do not infringe upon the rights of the other islands or otherwise threaten the state of the federal union.",
